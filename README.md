# MLA JIL Text Data

This repository contains corpora of text data mined from the MLA Jobs Information Lists. This is an on-going project that is meant to provide (1) a resource of plain text data for other scholars to analyze and (2) analyses of the MLA JIL data for rhetoric and writing studies. 

The raw text data for this project was extracted from PDFs downloaded at: http://rhetmap.org and https://www.mla.org/jil_issues

The writing studies related report for this data is available at: http://aaronbeveridge.com/mla-data. All of the code that generates this report is also available in this repository.
