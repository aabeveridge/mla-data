# MLA JIL Text Data

This repository is a curated collection of job descriptions mined from the MLA Jobs Information Lists. This is an on-going project meant to eventually enable the text mining of job description data from the JIL and other sources. 

The raw text data for this project was extracted from PDFs downloaded at: http://rhetmap.org and https://www.mla.org/jil_issues

# Writing and Rhetoric Jobs Analysis

The "Reports" folder in this repository will eventually have data visualizations and analyses specific to writing studies and rhetoric. This includes word frequency data, word correlation data, and year-to-year comparisons across all job description data.
