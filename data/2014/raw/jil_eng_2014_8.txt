i MLA JOB INFORMATION LIST • ENGLISH EDITION • 2013–14

About the JIL

Published by the MLA as an electronic database and as printable PDF editions, the JIL is the recognized 
professional source for announcements of full-time faculty positions available in the fields of English and foreign 
languages in North American colleges and universities. Access to search the JIL is free to all users. Listings 
primarily announce full-time academic job openings in postsecondary departments of English and foreign 
languages. The job openings range in rank from instructor to full professor and include faculty positions, 
administrative posts, vacancies abroad, and some opportunities for nonacademic employment.

Federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, sex, age, disability, or national 
origin. The MLA Job Information List reserves the right to edit all statements to conform with such regulations.



MLA Statements Relevant to the 
Hiring Process

(See also the Academic Workforce Advocacy Kit.)

Notice on Tenure Policies

The Modern Language Association recommends that department administrators and their representatives inform 
candidates before or during the interview about prospects for tenure in the specific position under consideration 
and about the tenure policies and practices in their departments and institutions. If the information is not offered, 
candidates are urged to inquire about these policies.

Acknowledgment of Applications

Acting on a recommendation from the MLA Delegate Assembly, the MLA Executive Council has adopted a policy 
calling for departments to acknowledge all applications for announced positions by letter, by e-mail, or by self-
addressed postcards provided by applicants.

MLA Policy on Reimbursement

The following policies were recommended by the Delegate Assembly in December 1999 and approved by the 
MLA Executive Council in February 2000.

It is MLA policy that

 • Departments that require that job applicants send their application materials by express courier reimburse 
those applicants for the cost of such shipment;

 • Departments that require multiple copies of writing samples and other application materials from job 
applicants reimburse applicants for the cost of duplicating their writing samples and other materials;

 • Departments that require books return them to the applicant;

 • Departments that invite job applicants for on-campus interviews reimburse those applicants who accept such 
invitations for the costs of travel and accommodations incurred when visiting the campus for interviews.

Recommendation on Domestic Partner Benefits

This recommendation grew out of a motion approved by the 2001 MLA Delegate Assembly. The MLA Executive 
Council gave final approval for the dissemination of the recommendation at its May 2002 meeting.

Institutions that offer domestic partner benefits are encouraged to indicate these benefits in their job 
announcements or in the benefit information they make available to candidates they wish to interview.

For related information, please see the MLA Statement on Non-Tenure-Track Faculty Members and the MLA 
Recommendation on Minimum Per-Course Compensation for Part-Time Faculty Members (see below).

MLA Recommendation on a Minimum Wage for Full-Time Entry-Level Faculty Members

The minimum salary range for full-time appointments at the entry level should be at least $47,370 to $51,660 for 
those at the rank of instructor and at least $59,800 to $64,520 for those at the rank of beginning assistant professor. 
Health care benefits and shared contributions to a portable retirement plan should also be provided.



MLA Recommendation on Minimum Per-Course Compensation for Part-Time 
Faculty Members

Recognizing that many variables enter into determinations of salary, the MLA believes that part-time faculty 
members should be compensated pro rata to salaries for full-time faculty members performing similar duties, whether 
by a per-course, per-credit-hour, or full-time-equivalent percentage. The following factors should be considered in 
determining compensation increases above annual minimums, as reflected in an appropriate salary schedule:

 • Instructional workload: number of contact hours, class size, advising, and method for evaluating student work 
and assigning grades (e.g., labor-intensive reading and commenting on student papers)

 • Ancillary duties, including but not limited to: recruitment; supervisory role and responsibilities; research, 
publication, other forms of professional development, and curriculum development

 • Length of academic term (i.e., semester, quarter, trimester, or other system)

 • Years of experience and professional degrees or other qualifications

 • Health and retirement benefits: If benefits are not available to the instructor, an equivalent add-on premium or 
stipend should be added to the base salary to compensate for lack of benefits.

 • Contracts or appointments: Higher than minimum rates of compensation should apply in cases where 
contracts or appointments are for one year or less and not renewable, have no provision for a career path 
consisting of a sequence of appointments leading to longer-term contracts, or (after a reasonable probationary 
period) provide no rights to due process procedures prior to termination.

Following a review of best practices in various institutions, the MLA recommends minimum compensation for 
2014–15 of $7,230 for a standard 3-credit-hour semester course or $4,820 for a standard 3-credit-hour quarter or 
trimester course. These recommendations are based on a full-time load of 3 courses per semester (6 per year) or 
3 courses per quarter or trimester (9 per year); annual full-time equivalent is thus $43,380.

If compensation rates were specifically tied, pro rata, to the MLA’s 2014–15 recommendation of a $47,370 
minimum annual salary for an entry-level, full-time instructor, these rates would be $7,890 for a standard 
3-credit-hour semester course and $5,260 for a standard 3-credit-hour quarter or trimester course. The MLA’s 
recommendation for the minimum salary for an entry-level, full-time instructor in English and foreign languages 
is calculated on the basis of averages of salaries reported annually for these fields by the College and University 
Professional Association for Human Resources (CUPA-HR).

MLA Statement on the Use of Part-Time and Full-Time Adjunct Faculty Members

The expansion of the adjunct ranks in language and literature departments over the past two decades threatens 
the integrity of the profession and instructional programs. The practice of hiring numerous adjunct faculty 
members year after year to teach courses required of large numbers of undergraduates undermines professional 
and educational standards and academic freedom. Although adjunct appointments can add significant dimensions 
to curricula and some individuals prefer to accept only adjunct appointments because of other commitments, few 
adjunct appointments are made for educationally sound reasons. Indeed, the primary motivation for most of these 
appointments is to reduce the cost of instruction.

Adjunct faculty members fall into two groups: part-time instructors and non-tenure-track full-time instructors. 
The first group includes both instructors who are clearly temporary members of a department and instructors 
who teach from year to year and become virtually permanent. Members of the second group have full teaching 
loads but, as non-tenure-track faculty members, lack the institutional commitment given to their tenure-track 
colleagues. Graduate students are distinct from both groups.

The conditions under which most adjunct teachers are employed define them as nonprofessionals. Often they are 
hired quickly, as last-minute replacements. They receive little recognition or respect for their contributions to their 
departments; almost always they are paid inequitably and receive no fringe benefits.

Excessive reliance on an adjunct faculty can damage individual faculty members, students, institutions, and the 
profession. For the sake of an institution’s economic welfare, adjunct faculty members are often denied the security 
that adequate salary, health insurance, and professional status can provide. The institution, in turn, suffers through 
the creation of a two-tiered system in which faculty members have different responsibilities and expectations.



In the light of these concerns, the MLA urges college and university administrators to make new and concerted 
efforts to eliminate excessive and irresponsible adjunct faculty appointments, to improve employment conditions 
for essential adjunct faculty members, and to recognize the professional status and important contributions of 
such teachers.

The MLA offers the following guidelines for the employment of adjunct faculty members.

Guidelines

1. Each department should establish an appropriate limit on the number of adjunct faculty members in relation to 
the number of tenured or tenure-track faculty members and of graduate students serving as apprentice teachers. 
The norm in a department should be the tenured or tenure-track position. As tenured faculty members retire, 
they should be replaced by tenure-track faculty members. Departments that routinely assign a large part of 
undergraduate instruction to adjunct faculty members should reconsider their staffing practices.

2. All adjunct faculty members should be treated as professionals. Each department should develop a set of 
guidelines for adjunct faculty employment. These guidelines may vary from institution to institution but should 
address the following concerns:

 a. Adjunct faculty members should be hired, reviewed, and given teaching assignments according to processes 
comparable to those established for the tenured or tenure-track faculty members.

 b. They should be given mailboxes, office space, and clerical support.

 c. They should receive adequate introduction to their teaching assignments, departments, and institutions.

 d. They should be paid equitable prorated salaries and should receive basic benefits such as health insurance.

 e. They should be eligible for incentives that foster professional development, including merit raises and funds 
for research and travel.

 f. As appropriate, they should participate in determining departmental and institutional policies.

List of Administrations Censured 
by the American Association of 
University Professors

Note: The following list and accompanying explanatory note are reprinted from www.aaup.org/our-programs/academic-freedom/
censure-list by permission of the American Association of University Professors and in accordance with the action of the MLA 
Delegate Assembly.

Investigations by the American Association of University Professors of the administrations of the institutions listed 
below show that, as evidenced by a past violation, they are not observing the generally recognized principles of 
academic freedom and tenure approved by this Association, the Association of American Colleges and Universities, 
and more than two hundred other professional and educational organizations which have endorsed the 1940 
Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure.

This list is published for the purpose of informing Association members, the profession at large, and the public that 
unsatisfactory conditions of academic freedom and tenure have been found to prevail at these institutions. Names 
are placed on or removed from this censure list by vote of the Association’s annual meeting.

Placing the name of an institution on this list does not mean that censure is visited either upon the whole of the 
institution or upon the faculty, but specifically upon its present administration. The term “administration” includes 
the administrative officers and the governing board of the institution. This censure does not affect the eligibility 
of nonmembers for membership in the Association, nor does it affect the individual rights of members at the 
institution in question.

Members of the Association have often considered it to be their duty, in order to indicate their support of the 
principles violated, to refrain from accepting appointment to an institution so long as it remains on the censure 
list. Since circumstances differ widely from case to case, the Association does not assert that such an unqualified 
obligation exists for its members; it does urge that, before accepting appointments, they seek information on 
present conditions of academic freedom and tenure from the Association’s Washington office and prospective 
departmental colleagues. The Association leaves it to the discretion of the individual, possessed of the facts, to 
make the proper decision.

Institutions are listed in chronological order according to when their administrations were placed on the censure 
list. The list contains only administrations which are still under censure (many others have been removed from the 
list after improving their practices and procedures). Reports through 2009 were published in the AAUP Bulletin 
or Academe, and the issue of publication is indicated in the “Report Published” column. Starting in 2010, reports 
were published first on the AAUP website, in the month and year indicated in the “Report Published” column, 
with print publication following in the next issue of the Bulletin of the AAUP. In rare cases, a supplemental report 
has been issued after the initial report.

Full-Time Non-Tenure-Track Positions in Writing 20093

https://apply.interfolio.com/23637

The University of Southern California Writing Program in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in Los 
Angeles, California, seeks qualified applicants for full-time non-tenure-track teaching positions—Lecturer, Senior 
Lecturer, Master Lecturer, Assistant Professor (Teaching), Associate Professor (Teaching), and Professor (Teaching)—
to join our faculty beginning Fall 2014.

The Writing Program teaches courses that fulfill the undergraduate writing requirement in a context informed by the 
rhetorical tradition, process theory, and ethical discursive practices. First-year courses develop students' writing and 
critical reasoning skills within thematic contexts. Advanced courses, composed primarily of juniors and seniors, bring 
students together based on their academic interests and career goals, addressing writing in different disciplines for various 
audiences. Small class sizes in both first-year and upper-level courses facilitate a workshop model of instruction, 
frequent one-on-one and small-group conferencing, and an emphasis on the writing process.

Full-time non-tenure-track faculty teach three sections each semester, for which they will develop syllabi and assignments 
in accordance with program guidelines. The Writing Program also provides significant opportunities for professional 
growth and development. Faculty are eligible to participate in program, college, and university governance. 
New faculty will join a vibrant community of teachers, writers, and scholars composed of faculty and graduate students 
from a range of disciplines.

The Writing Program hopes to hire faculty interested in making a career of teaching writing at USC. Initial appointments 
are fixed-term, with the possibility of renewal contingent on performance and review by the program faculty, 
its directors, and the college deans. Dornsife provides opportunities for promotion based on demonstrated teaching 
excellence and service to the program, school, and university.

Qualifications

Candidates should have a PhD or other terminal degree by June 2014. We require demonstrated excellence in teaching 
writing at the college level and we value familiarity with the needs of writers whose first language is not English. 
While many of our faculty have scholarly backgrounds in English 
Literature or Rhetoric and Composition, we welcome 
candidates from all fields.

Application Procedure

The deadline for applications is December 2, 2013. Applicants should submit a letter of application, CV, teaching 
evaluations and the names of three referees who can speak to teaching abilities. The referees will be contacted directly 
by USC. In order to be considered for this position, applicants are required to submit an electronic USC application;

Laurance S. Rockefeller Visiting Faculty Fellowships 19852

https://apply.interfolio.com/23304

The University Center for Human Values invites applications for Laurance S. Rockefeller Visiting Faculty Fellowships 
for the academic year 2014–15. Fellows devote an academic year in residence at Princeton to do research and writing 
about topics involving human values in public and private life. The program is open to scholars in all disciplines provided 
their research plans qualify. In recent years fellows have been drawn from fields including philosophy, political 
theory, literature, history, classics, economics and law, but this list is not meant to be exhaustive.

Fellows are expected to reside in or around Princeton and to be active contributors to the intellectual life of the Center. 
This includes participating in a weekly seminar attended by fellows and Center faculty to discuss work in progress 
and in various other seminars, colloquia and lectures sponsored by the Center. Fellows enjoy access to Firestone Library 
and to a wide range of activities throughout the University.

Candidates should have a doctorate or equivalent professional degree and a strong record of research publications appropriate 
to their career stage. Typically Fellows hold faculty positions at other universities or colleges; in exceptional 
cases we consider applications from independent scholars when there is a high level of scholarly achievement. This is 
not a post-doctoral fellowship program and we do not generally consider candidates who will have held the Ph.D. for 
less than two years at the time of appointment.

The fellowship period extends from September 1 to July 1. Fellows normally receive stipends of up to one-half their 
academic-year salaries (subject to a minimum and maximum set each fall). Ordinarily their home institutions provide 
a portion of their salaries in addition to all benefits, although this is not a requirement for appointment. Stipends for 
independent scholars will not exceed the maximum for fellows holding appointments elsewhere.

The main considerations in the evaluation of applications are the following:

The significance of the proposed research and its relevance to the purposes of the University Center for Human Values 
(see http:// uchv .princeton .edu/ for more information);

The quality of a candidate’s previous research and the contribution the candidate is likely to make in the future 
through teaching and writing;

The likelihood that the research would benefit from being conducted in the University Center environment.

HOW TO APPLY Candidates should submit an online application at http:// jobs .princeton .edu. Search for requisition 
number 1300435.

The following materials will be required:



1. A curriculum vitae;

2. A scholarly paper (of no more than about 12,000 words) written in the past three years;

3. A statement (of no more than 1,500 words) describing the proposed research project; and

4. Contact information for three referees, including at least one who was not a graduate advisor. Referees will be contacted 
directly with instructions for uploading letters of reference.

These materials should be submitted online by Monday, November 4, 2013. We do not accept application materials by 
any other method. Letters of reference are to be submitted by November 6. The selection committee begins reviewing 
applications immediately and incomplete applications may be at a disadvantage. Decisions are expected to be announced 
by March 17, 2014.

the Faculty Senate’s 2013 vote in favor of requiring all degree-seeking undergraduate students to take a foun



dational course emphasizing writing and information literacy. A pilot group, working under the aegis of the general 
education committee of the Faculty Senate, developed common outcomes that can be realized via first year composition, 
the Honors College first-year seminar, and first-year seminars offered in every department in the College of Arts 
and Sciences (CAS). The director will work closely with administrators and faculty in CAS and the Honors College 
as well as instructional librarians, to lead faculty development, support curricular development, and design and coordinate 
assessment in the program. While the formal first-year writing requirement is new, the director will join the 
Writing Center director, the director of Writing in the Disciplines, and English 
department faculty in composition 
and rhetoric on a campus with a long tradition of valuing undergraduate education. [R]

For artists and humanists, these are extraordinary times: our sense of “the human” is undergoing remarkable transformations, 
with implications for the future of all life on the planet. But has “humanism” been part of the problem all 
along? How should we think differently–about the biosphere and the social world–if we are going to avoid realizing 
our deepest dystopian fears?

The Penn State IAH welcomes applications from scholars and artists who have received their terminal degrees (PhDs 
in the humanities, MFAs in the fine and performing arts, Masters or beyond in design fields such as architecture) 
within the past three years (after May 1, 2011). Terminal degrees must be in hand by July 1, 2014. Applications should 
include a CV, contact information for two references, a project description of 1000 words, and (for applicants in the 
arts or design) a hyperlink or other access to a digital portfolio. The fellowship stipend is $46,000 plus benefits and 
a $4,000 research fund. An office will be provided at the Institute. The successful candidate will be asked to teach a 
course, lead a faculty/graduate student research group, and/or organize a symposium. Further, it is expected that the 
fellow will take part in the intellectual life of campus by working with faculty and students, attending symposia and 
events, and contributing to meetings and discussions presented by IAH.

All application materials must be submitted through http:// www .la .psu .edu/ facultysearch/ by January 15, 2014.

The Jackman Humanities Institute at the University of Toronto seeks 3 Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellows for a 
two-year appointment 2014–2016 with research relevant to the 2014–15 theme:

Humour, Play, and Games

A distinctive human quality is our sense of humour, and our attraction to play and to games. Play is central to such 
fields as literature, music, poetry, art, and film. Humour can, of course, be very serious: a powerful critique, a source 
of strength to survive, a tool for building solidarity, and a means of drawing and redrawing limits. But humour also 
poses a challenge to the serious. Today, when scholarship needs to justify itself and time is money, what room is left 
for play and humour? Can they be justified along functional and economic lines (e.g. play is the seedbed of the genuinely 
new) or must we resist justification in the name of play itself? What is an old joke worth? Games can be both 
competitive and collaborative, and play is structured by the virtual spaces games create. Playing games and studying 
games fosters new modes of knowledge. This theme will allow all disciplines, those that have long-recognized the 
aesthetic importance of humour and play and those that traditionally have not, to intersect with new thinking about 
games, and so explore a full range of serious (and sometimes funny) play.

Fellowships begin 1 July 2014. Eligibility: Ph.D. awarded between 1 July 2011 and 30 May 2014.

postsecularism” and how are they theorized, represented, or institutionalized in different societies and times? How are 
they related to such social and cultural formations as modernity, war, empire, nation, science, spirituality, the work of 
art, power, indigeneity, politics, government, migration, race, sustainability, or territoriality, both past and present? 
What role do they play in constructions of gender, sexuality, or disability? How do religion, secularism, and postsecularism 
inform aesthetics across time, media, and genre? We invite applications from researchers across the humanities 
and humanistic social sciences.

https://apply.interfolio.com/24757

The United States-Israel Educational Foundation (USIEF), the Fulbright commission for Israel, plans to offer 8 fellowships 
to American post-doctoral researchers in support of work to be carried out at Israeli universities during the 
course of the 2015/2016–2016/2017 academic years.

The US Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program is open to candidates in all academic disciplines.

Holders of tenure track positions are not eligible to apply. Individuals who have already begun research activities in 
Israel prior to the application date are not eligible.

Program grants total $40,000, $20,000 per academic year.

Program Fellows must be accepted as post-doctoral researchers by Israeli host institutions, which agree to provide 
them with a standard post-doctoral grant, which they will receive in addition to their Fulbright Fellowship. Thus, the 
total financial support received by Program Fellows is likely to be in the range of at least $35,000-$40,000 per year.

Applications for 2015/2016–2016/2017 Fulbright Post-Doctoral Fellowships must be submitted to the Council for International 
Exchange of Scholars by August 1, 2014.
