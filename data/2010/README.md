# 2012 MLA JIL Job Description Data

The raw text file located in the "Raw" folder was pulled from the 2012 MLA JIL PDFs using the Linux command line utility Pdftotext. The file was then processed into separate text files--one for each job description--with the mla_process.r script. And then finally, the separate text files were reduced to only those which contain the following words: "rhetoric," "composition," "writing," "technical."
