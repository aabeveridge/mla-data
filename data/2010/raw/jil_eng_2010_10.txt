Information for Candidates

The October List contains information on vacancies from departments of English, Comparative Literature, and Linguistics in US 
and Canadian colleges and universities, as well as some number of overseas institutions and nonacademic enterprises. The listings 
describe approximately 330 definite or possible positions. 

Guide for Using the Job Information List

US and Canadian Departments

The main body of the List, arranged in alphabetical order by state, 
contains information on definite or possible vacancies, comments on 
notices published in past issues (e.g., that a previously announced position 
has been filled), and notices from departments that expect no 
vacancies but would nevertheless like to keep résumés on file.

Read through this section item by item to see which departments 
would welcome your letter of application or inquiry at this time. Send 
letters 
only to departments expressing an interest in a person with your 
qualifications. If a notice states that no vacancies are expected but that 
the department would like to maintain a file of prospective candidates, 
you must decide in each case whether it is worthwhile to write.

General Advice for Candidates

Be sure that your dossier (transcript, letters of recommendation, and 
other material) is ready to be sent out by your placement bureau to any 
department that requests it. Prepare and duplicate a one-page vita sheet to 
enclose with any letters of application or inquiry. In your letter of application, 
it is probably wise to express a willingness to be interviewed at the 
department’s convenience. Professional meetings provide a convenient 
opportunity for such interviews (see list of upcoming meetings below).

While it is important to begin to search for a position immediately, 
you should be aware that hiring goes on all year. Surveys indicate 
that only about half of all English and foreign language departments 
have begun recruiting by the end of December and that the majority 
of departments do not complete the recruiting process until spring, 
in some cases until summer.

Bear in mind that the candidate who has not limited his or her 
search for a new position to a particular geographical area or kind of 
institution is most likely to find a position. Do not discount the small 
colleges where one often has the opportunity to teach a wide selection 
of courses to students of varied backgrounds.

Notice on Tenure Policies

The Modern Language Association recommends that department 
administrators and their representatives inform candidates before or 
during the interview about prospects for tenure in the specific position 
under consideration and about the tenure policies and practices 
in their departments and institutions. If the information is not offered, 
candidates are urged to inquire about these policies.

Acknowledgment of Applications

Acting on a recommendation from the MLA Delegate Assembly, 
the MLA Executive Council has adopted a policy calling for 
departments to acknowledge all applications for announced positions 
either by letter or by self-addressed postcards provided by 
applicants.

MLA Policy on the Reimbursement of Job Seekers

The following policies were recommended by the Delegate Assembly 
in December 1999 and approved by the MLA Executive 
Council in February 2000.

It is MLA policy that:

 • Departments that require that job applicants send their application 
materials by express carrier reimburse those applicants for 
the cost of such shipment; and

 • Departments that require multiple copies of writing samples and 
other application materials from job applicants reimburse applicants 
for the cost of duplicating their writing samples and other 
materials; and

 • Departments that require books will return them to the applicant; 
and

 • Departments that invite job applicants for on-campus interviews 
reimburse those applicants who accept such invitations for the 
costs of travel and accommodations incurred when visiting the 
campus for interviews.

Professional Meetings

In addition to the MLA convention (6–9 January 2011, Los Angeles), 
candidates in English, foreign languages, comparative literature, 
and linguistics may be interested in the following regional meetings.

Advice to Search Committee Members and Job Seekers on

Faculty Recruitment and Hiring

Prepared by the MLA Committee on Academic Freedom and Professional Rights and Responsibilities

I. General Principles

1. Everyone in the profession benefits when job searches go well. 
Timely, open communication can ensure an atmosphere of collegiality 
between departments and candidates, even when the job market 
is tight or institutional circumstances are uncertain. Departments help 
to create such an atmosphere when they recognize how vulnerable 
candidates may feel during a job search; candidates help when they 
recognize that departments may be affected by institutional policies 
largely beyond their control. Problems arising during a job search 
may lead to impressions that damage individuals or institutions; however, 
professional conduct by all parties involved in a job search may 
prevent such problems and can only be beneficial to all.

2. All job candidates should be treated equitably. Throughout 
any search for new faculty members, departments should adhere to 
nondiscrimination 
and affirmative action guidelines, taking particular 
care not to discriminate on the basis of race, ethnic or national origin, 
religion, disability, age, gender, or sexual orientation. The principles 
of confidentiality should be respected by all parties.

II. Advertising and Initial Screening

1. Advertisements for an opening should be as specific as possible 
about the availability of the opening (definite, likely, or possible), the 
type of appointment (tenure-track or non-tenure-track), minimum 
degree requirements, field(s) of expertise, minimum teaching experience, 
and any other requirements or criteria.

2. Applicants should be allowed ample time to respond to advertisements 
of openings, and deadlines for applications should be specified 
whenever possible. Normally, applications should be accepted for 
at least twenty-one days after the announced publication date for a 
given issue of the Job Information List (about 15 October, 15 November, 
15 February, and 15 April). Care should be taken to inform applicants 
of the department’s projected timetable for making decisions 
about interviews at the MLA convention, and applicants should be 
kept informed of their status following the initial screening.

3. Applications submitted in response to announcements should 
be acknowledged promptly and courteously in writing (if possible, 
within two weeks), and care should be taken to inform applicants of 
their status following the initial screening. Acting on a recommendation 
from the MLA Delegate Assembly, the MLA Executive Council 
has adopted a policy calling for departments to acknowledge 
all applications 
for announced positions either by letter or by self-
addressed 
postcards provided by applicants.

III. Preparing Applications

1. The candidate should prepare a dossier, including a letter of 
application, curriculum vitae, transcript(s), and letters of recommendation, 
by the end of September, before the October issue of the Job 
Information List. It is the candidate’s responsibility to make sure that 
all requested materials are supplied.

2. For the purpose of initial screening, a letter of application and 
dossier should normally suffice. To save all parties time and money, 
the committee recommends that departments request writing samples 
and other material only after a preliminary list of candidates has 
been chosen.

IV. Setting Up MLA Interviews

1. Candidates should realize that the department advertising in 
the Job Information List normally expects candidates to attend the 
MLA convention for screening interviews. Candidates who do not 
attend the convention may therefore be at a disadvantage. In such 
cases a telephone interview may be an appropriate alternative. Departments 
and candidates should realize that convention attendance 
is generally the most efficient and least expensive way to conduct 
interviews. Departments should make every effort to be represented 
at the convention by at least one member of the search committee.

2. Departments need to be able to reach candidates quickly between 
1 and 24 December. Candidates who travel in December 
should supply departments with complete itineraries including telephone 
numbers. Because of the expenses related to convention attendance, 
departments should notify all candidates, including those 
not invited for interviews, of their status as early as possible.

3. Candidates applying from outside North America should have 
a contact in the United States to receive mail and messages. Since 
few departments 
have resources to bring candidates to on-campus 
interviews from outside North America, candidates who reside 
abroad should determine arrangements for any on-campus interviews 
during MLA convention interviews.

4. To be sure that candidates can get the information they need to 
keep interview appointments at the convention, a department chair 
or search committee chair should stop by the job center soon after 
checking into a hotel, fill out the appropriate forms, and then check 
the “Who’s Where” listing for accuracy.

5. Departments need to be sure candidates know where the 
interview is taking place. The Job Information Center is set up to

Bembo–author: 13/16 it, text: 10/12, introtext: 10/12 it, censured: 8/10 w/ bd; DanteTitling MT–title: 35/40 Sc, subtitle: 20/30 Sc; Dante–ahead: 12/12 bd, bhead: 11/12 it, rf & folio: 




provide this information. If you plan to use the convention interview 
area, you need to sign in with the Job Information Center and 
hand in your schedule. If you are interviewing in a hotel room, remember 
that the hotel switchboard personnel are not authorized to 
disclose room numbers. You can register your room number and a 
list of interviewees with the Job Information Center, so that your 
room number will be given out only to the candidates with whom 
your department has set up appointments. Departments scheduled 
to begin interviewing on the first afternoon of the convention may 
need to arrive the day before, to avoid missing appointments because 
of travel delays or delays in checking into hotels.

6. Departments and candidates should plan realistically and adhere 
closely to schedules. When arranging interviews, candidates should 
leave as much time as possible between appointments, keeping in 
mind that they may have to deal with crowded elevators, slow meal 
service, or delayed shuttle buses. Departments should remember that 
interviews that run late may prevent candidates from keeping other 
appointments and that one instance of lateness can multiply into a 
whole series of missed or delayed interviews.

7. Whether held on or off campus, in person or by telephone, 
interviews should be conducted in a professional manner, permitting 
candidates adequate opportunity to explain and demonstrate 
their qualifications. Candidates and departments should review “Dos 
and Don’ts for Interviews,” by Herbert Lederer, revised in 1995 by 
CAFPRR 
and reprinted each October in the Job Information List.

8. Interviewers should make every effort to accommodate candidates 
with disabilities.

V. Interviewing on Campus

1. Departments inviting candidates for on-campus interviews 
should pay candidates’ expenses, following standard institutional policies 
for travel reimbursement. Candidates should be told approximately 
how many others are being invited for on-campus interviews.


2. On-campus interviews represent a large investment of time and 
money for departments; therefore, candidates should not accept on-
campus interviews if they are not seriously interested in the position. 
Before traveling to a campus, candidates should thoroughly research 
the department’s faculty and programs. Candidates should find out 
what salary range and teaching load have been established for the 
position and should decide in advance what their own minimum 
requirements are. It is important that candidates also determine in 
advance whether their decisions may be influenced by special circumstances 
that should be communicated to the chair.

3. A department that invites a candidate to interview on its 
campus has an obligation to (a) arrange the logistics of the candidate’s 
stay (local transportation, lodging—including disability 
accommodations, meals); (b) set up interviews with faculty members 
and administrators; (c) provide a tour of the campus and its 
facilities; (d) provide adequate information about the department, 
the university, and the community; (e) plan social activities for 
the candidate; and (f) inform the candidate of the procedures and 
timetable for reimbursement.

4. Members of departments and search committees should not 
discuss other candidates with a visiting candidate.

VI. Negotiating an Offer

1. To minimize misunderstanding and anxiety during negotiations 
about offers, departments should establish ground rules in advance and 
let candidates know what these are before any offers are made. Departments 
should communicate with candidates regularly and openly 
about the status of the search process. All parties should be aware that, 
especially in times of fiscal uncertainty, circumstances beyond the institution’s 
control may delay or disrupt the hiring process.

2. No candidate should be required before 22 January to give a 
final answer to an offer of a position without tenure for the following 
academic year. After 22 January, candidates should normally be 
allowed two weeks to give a final answer to a formal offer.

The committee welcomes comments and suggestions from members. Direct

Professional Rights and Responsibilities, MLA, 26 Broadway, 3rd floor, New

Checklist for Job Seekers

The MLA Committee on Careers offers this checklist as an aid for first-time job seekers and as a guide for graduate departments 
about ways they can facilitate the placement of their graduates. As an association, the MLA has a vital interest in establishing 
procedures and practices that make the job search as effective and professional as possible. 

Prepreparation

. Have you completed your dissertation? If not, do you have a realistic 
schedule for completing it? 

. Have you defined the kind(s) of institution(s) where you would like 
to teach? 

. Have you informed yourself about the job market? Have you consulted, 
for example, the Job Information List, the Chronicle of Higher 
Education, and the ADE Bulletin or ADFL Bulletin about the job 
situation? 

. Have you spoken to recently hired faculty members about their experiences 
in the job market? 

. Have you been realistic in defining the kinds of specialized courses 
you are qualified to teach? Have you articulated what you have to 
offer as a scholar and a teacher? What are the limits of the jobs for 
which you really qualify? 

. Have you spoken to one or more of the following persons about 
the job search: your department placement officer, your department 
graduate adviser, your dissertation adviser, your department placement 
committee, other faculty members who know you well and 
who have shown interest in your work? 

. Have you requested from your department or placement office standardized 
forms for your letters of recommendation? 

. Have you requested letters from three to five faculty members who 
feel positively about you and who know your course work, dissertation, 
and teaching? 

. Have you given your referees sufficient information about your record 
and at least several weeks to prepare their letters of recommendation? 

. Have you estimated the costs of the job search? Although costs will 
vary, it is reasonable to expect to spend at least $700 for travel, lodging, 
food, and incidentals when attending the MLA convention. 
Remember too that you will have duplicating and postage expenses, 
fees charged by the placement office for sending your dossier, long-
distance phone charges, and expenses for purchase or rental of a 
telephone answering machine to receive calls before and after the 
convention. Although you should expect to be reimbursed for travel 
to on-campus interviews, you will probably have to pay airfare in 
advance. It is a good idea to establish credit and acquire a credit card 
if possible. When you are called for an on-campus interview, be sure 
to ask whether your expenses will be reimbursed. 

. Have you requested a mock interview? If your department does not 
regularly schedule mock interviews for job candidates, have you discussed 
with several faculty members the kinds of questions you can 
expect to be asked and issues to be discussed?

. Have you considered requesting disability-related accommodations 
to facilitate your interview?

The MLA Convention

. Have you planned your interview schedule for the MLA convention, 
making sure that you have allowed enough time to get from 
one hotel to another? 

. Do you have the information you need about the school and the 
department to which you have applied (e.g., course offerings, college 
and university requirements, faculty members)? 

. Have you reviewed the list of “dos and don’ts” for interviewees? 

The On-Campus Interview

. Have you determined beforehand the schedule of your visit and the 
meetings you will be asked to take part in? Have you asked the department 
to add things to your itinerary (e.g., a tour of the library, a 
meeting with students) that were not originally scheduled? 

. Have you inquired in advance of your trip whether you will be 
reimbursed for expenses you incur for the on-campus interview? 
Have you done careful research beforehand about the faculty and 
curriculum of the school you will be visiting? 

. Will you be required to make a formal presentation to faculty and/
or students while on campus? If so, have you carefully prepared this 
presentation? Are you prepared to discuss your dissertation in detail? 

. Have you received all the information you will need in order to 
make a decision if offered a job—information about salary, fringe 
benefits, moving expenses, tenure policies, any other terms of the 
contract, and the amount of time you will have to consider the 
offer?

. Have you informed the department of any necessary disability-
related 
accommodations to facilitate your interview?

After an Offer Is Made

. Are you well informed about the general financial health of the 
college or university, its enrollment trends, its support for the 
humanities, 
the distribution of majors, and the faculty members in 
your discipline?

. Are you clear about what your own teaching responsibilities will 
be? Do you know what your course load and approximate class sizes 
will be? 

. Do your research interests have a clear place in the department? 
Have you asked about support for your research, including the availability 
of grants, sabbatical and released time? 

. Do you know the criteria and procedures for tenure and 
promotion? 


. Do you have an informed opinion about the advantages and disadvantages 
of living in the city or town where the college or university 
is located? Have you asked, for example, about housing, the cost 
of living, cultural and social opportunities, local politics, and public 
schools? 

. You should not be required to respond before 22 January to an offer 
of a position without tenure for the following academic year. If you 
receive an offer between 22 January and the middle of the summer, 
you should be allowed two weeks to make a decision. But once you 
have definitely made up your mind about an offer, you should accept 
or reject it immediately: keep in mind that other candidates 
will be affected by your decision. 

Things to Remember If You Don’t Get an Offer

. The hiring season is not over in January; only the first wave has 
passed by then. 

. While many offers are made in January, an offer in February does 
not necessarily mean that you are a second choice. It may mean 
that the department has had to wait a month to reconvene its search 
committee or receive final approval for funding. 

. You may be on the market too early. The department may not have 
been convinced that you will actually finish your dissertation by the 
time specified. 

. You may have pinned your hopes on too narrow a selection of 
schools. 

. You can still inquire about your status at places where you have interviewed. 
You may still be on their lists. 

. New jobs open up after the MLA convention. Keep reading the 
Job Information List through the summer supplement and consult the 
advertisements in the Chronicle of Higher Education and other professional 
publications. 

. There will be another job market next year. Start preparing for it 
now. The current search will have given you valuable experience.

Dos and Don’ts 

for MLA Convention Interviews

by Herbert Lederer, University of Connecticut 
with revisions by Committee on Academic Freedom and Professional Rights and Responsibilities, 1995

The job interview is an event that has caused sufficient anxiety for both interviewer and interviewee to prompt a number 
of publications dealing with the topic. In recent years, concern about discrimination in the hiring process has led to a heightened 
awareness of the possibility of discriminatory intent in the questions asked by interviewers. In order to facilitate the conduct of 
interviews arranged through the MLA Job Information Service, guidelines have been developed for both interviewers and job 
candidates.

Do

Schedule interviews at reasonable times and allow for adequate time

Leave time between interviews to review dossiers and make postinterview 
notes

List of Administrations Censured

by the American Association of University Professors

Note: The following list and accompanying explanatory note are reprinted from Academe by permission of the American Association 
of University Professors and in accordance with the action of the MLA Delegate Assembly.

Investigations by the American Association of University Professors of the 
administrations of the institutions listed below show that, as evidenced by a 
past violation, they are not observing the generally recognized principles of 
academic freedom and tenure endorsed by this Association, the Association of 
American Colleges and Universities, and more than 150 other professional and 
educational organizations. The 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom 
and Tenure may be found in the May-June 1990 issue of Academe.

This list is published for the purpose of informing Association members, the 
profession at large, and the public that unsatisfactory conditions of academic 
freedom and tenure have been found to prevail at these institutions. Names are 
placed on or removed from this censure list by vote of the Association’s Annual 
Meeting.

Placing the name of an institution on this list does not mean that censure 
is visited either upon the whole of the institution or upon the faculty, but specifically 
upon its present administration. The term “administration” includes the 
administrative officers and the governing board of the institution. This censure 
does not affect the eligibility of nonmembers for membership in the Association, 
nor does it affect the individual rights of members at the institution in 
question.

Members of the Association have often considered it to be their duty, in 
order to indicate their support of the principles violated, 
to refrain from accepting 
appointment to an institution so long as it remains on the censure list. Since 
circumstances differ widely from case to case, the Association does not assert 
that such an unqualified obligation exists for its members; it does urge that, 
before accepting appointments, they seek information on present conditions 
of academic freedom and tenure from the Association’s Washington office and 
prospective departmental colleagues. The Association leaves it to the discretion 
of the individual, possessed of the facts, to make the proper decision.

The censured administrations, with dates of censuring, are listed below. Reports 
were published as indicated by the Bulletin or Academe citations in parentheses 
following each listing. Reference should also be made to “Developments 
Relating to Censure by the Association” and to the “Report of Committee A,” 
each of which appears annually in Academe.

MLA Statement on the Use of

Part-Time and Full-Time 
Adjunct Faculty

The following statement on the use of part-time and full-time adjunct faculty members was developed by an ad hoc committee of the 
Association of Departments of English and adopted by the MLA Executive Council in February 1994.

The expansion of the adjunct ranks in language and literature departments 
over the past two decades threatens the integrity of the profession 
and instructional programs. The practice of hiring numerous 
adjunct faculty members year after year to teach courses required of 
large numbers of undergraduates undermines professional and educational 
standards and academic freedom. Although adjunct appointments 
can add significant dimensions to curricula and some individuals prefer 
to accept only adjunct appointments because of other commitments, 
few adjunct appointments are made for educationally sound reasons. 
Indeed, the primary motivation for most of these appointments is to 
reduce the cost of instruction.

Adjunct faculty members fall into two groups: part-time instructors 
and non-tenure-track full-time instructors. The first group includes 
both instructors who are clearly temporary members of a 
department and instructors who teach from year to year and become 
virtually permanent. Members of the second group have full teaching 
loads but, as non-tenure-track faculty 
members, lack the institutional 
commitment given to their tenure-track colleagues. Graduate 
students are distinct from both groups.

The conditions under which most adjunct teachers are employed 
define them as nonprofessionals. Often they are hired quickly, as last-
minute replacements. They receive little recognition or respect for 
their contributions to their departments; almost always they are paid 
inequitably and receive no fringe benefits.

Excessive reliance on an adjunct faculty can damage individual 
faculty members, students, institutions, and the profession. For the 
sake of an institution’s economic welfare, adjunct faculty members 
are often denied the security that adequate salary, health insurance, 
and professional status can provide. The institution, in turn, suffers 
through the creation of a two-tiered system in which faculty members 
have different responsibilities and expectations.

In the light of these concerns, the MLA urges college and university 
administrators to make new and concerted efforts to eliminate 
excessive and irresponsible adjunct faculty appointments, to improve 
employment conditions for essential adjunct faculty members, and to 
recognize the professional status and important contributions of such 
teachers. 

The MLA offers the following guidelines for the employment of 
faculty 
members.

Guidelines

1. Each department should establish an appropriate limit on the 
number of adjunct faculty members in relation to the number of tenured 
or tenure-track faculty members and of graduate students serving 
as apprentice teachers. The norm in a department should be the 
tenured or tenure-track position. As tenured faculty members retire, 
they should be replaced by tenure-track faculty members. Departments 
that routinely assign a large part of undergraduate instruction 
to adjunct faculty members should reconsider their staffing practices.

2. All adjunct faculty members should be treated as professionals. 
Each department should develop a set of guidelines for adjunct 
faculty employment. These guidelines may vary from institution to 
institution but should address the following concerns:

a. Adjunct faculty members should be hired, reviewed, and 
given teaching assignments according to processes comparable to 
those established for the tenured or tenure-track faculty members.

b. They should be given mailboxes, office space, and clerical 
support.


c. They should receive adequate introduction to their teaching 
assignments, departments, and institutions.

d. They should be paid equitable prorated salaries and should 
receive basic benefits such as health insurance.

e. They should be eligible for incentives that foster professional 
development, including merit raises and funds for research 
and travel.

f. As appropriate, they should participate in determining departmental 
and institutional policies.

Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Humanities 12991

The Jackman Humanities Institute at the University of Toronto is pleased 
to announce Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowships in the Humanities. 
Three Fellows will be selected for a two-year fellowship on the basis 
of accomplishment, promise of excellence, and relevance of their research 
to the 2011–12 theme, Location/ Dislocation:

The experience of dislocation prompts insight into how people and ideas 
inhabit space, and what happens as they move. Many experiences of uprooting 
and exile are unwelcome; arrivals in new locations often generate 
violence and intolerance. The arts and books, languages and stories of the 



old country often remain vital for immigrants, creating diasporic cultures 
of memory and need; at times the hybridity created in a new place is not a 
simple amalgam or a peaceful overwriting. Cities are the common site of 
exile and new creations, and in their architecture and overlapping communities 
of trade, worship, and education, cities provide an archival record 
of the disruptive encounters that result from dislocation. The task 
of humanities research is to engage these complex practices of memory, 
importation, colonization, and assimilation.

Fellowships begin 1 July 2011. Eligibility: Ph.D. between 1 July 2008 and 
30 May 2011.

Writing and Critical Thinking Programme Faculty Positions

We are looking for colleagues who can teach academic writing through 
topic-specific interdisciplinary courses. The positions will be in the University 
Scholars Programme (USP), a premier undergraduate honours 
programme at the National University of Singapore, one of Asia’s leading 
research universities.

The two posts are non-tenure track lecturerships, normally contracted 
for three years in the first instance and renewable indefinitely subject to 
good performance. The majority of courses to be taught will be the USP 
“Writing and Critical Thinking (WCT) modules, though appointees will 
also have the opportunity to develop and teach the occasional non-writing 
module in USP.

The normal teaching load is 2/2, and each WCT class, because of its intensity, 
is capped at 12 students. WCT courses are rigorous and intellectually 
engaging, and focus more on critical thinking than on the mechanics 
of composition. Classes are interdisciplinary and themed around a content 
area developed by the instructor, but with writing and critical thinking 
components that are consistent across all WCT courses.

Candidates should hold a PhD or be ABD with the expectation of completion 
by June 2011, and have prior experience teaching undergraduate 
argumentative writing. Disciplinary specialty is open, but we are especially 
interested in candidates who are active scholars in their fields, and 
who regard writing as foundational for academic success.

Remuneration and benefits are highly competitive.

We are looking for candidates who can begin in July 2011. Completed 
applications received by the 30th October 2010 will receive full consideration.


Interested applicants should submit their applications with a cover letter; 
a resume; and a statement of the principles that underlie their teaching. 
Shortlisted applicants will be asked to provide further information and to 
make a campus visit. Please send applications to uspbox24@ nus .edu.sg or

history, generated by immigrant and minority writers, artists, filmmakers,

the world and thereby reshaping the canons of literature, art, and music 
in their respective countries. To apply, please visit our website at http://

1, 2010 (please note new application deadline). The program is

have defined the social sciences in the modern period. Currently, Fellows 
teach in four of the year-long sequences into which the Core is organized: 
Self, Culture and Society; Classics of Social and Political Thought; 
and Power, Identity, and Resistance; and Social Science Inquiry. For a
