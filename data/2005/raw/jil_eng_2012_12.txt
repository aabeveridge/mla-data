i MLA JOB INFORMATION LIST • ENGLISH EDITION • December 2012

Information for Candidates

The December List contains information on vacancies from departments of English, comparative literature, and linguistics in US and 
Canadian colleges and universities, as well as some number of overseas institutions and nonacademic enterprises. 

Guide for Using the Job Information List

US and Canadian Departments

The main body of the List, arranged in alphabetical order by state, contains information on definite or possible 
vacancies, comments on notices published in past issues (e.g., that a previously announced position has been filled), 
and notices from departments that expect no vacancies but would nevertheless like to keep résumés on file.

Read through this section item by item to see which departments would welcome your letter of application or inquiry 
at this time. Send letters 
only to departments expressing an interest in a person with your qualifications. If a notice states 
that no vacancies are expected but that the department would like to maintain a file of prospective candidates, 
you 
must decide in each case whether it is worthwhile to write.

General Advice for Candidates

Be sure that your dossier (transcript, letters of recommendation, and other material) is ready to be sent out by your 
placement bureau to any department that requests it. Prepare and duplicate a one-page vita sheet to enclose with 
any letters of application or inquiry. In your letter of application, it is probably wise to express a willingness to be 
interviewed at the department’s convenience. Professional meetings provide a convenient opportunity for such interviews 
(see MLA convention information on pp. iii–iv).

While it is important to begin to search for a position immediately, you should be aware that hiring goes on all year. 
Surveys indicate that only about half of all English and foreign language departments have begun recruiting by the 
end of December and that the majority of departments do not complete the recruiting process until spring, in some 
cases until summer.

Bear in mind that the candidate who has not limited his or her search for a new position to a particular geographical 
area or kind of institution is most likely to find a position. Do not discount the small colleges where one often 
has the opportunity to teach a wide selection of courses to students of varied backgrounds.

Notice on Tenure Policies

The Modern Language Association recommends that department administrators and their representatives inform 
candidates before or during the interview about prospects for tenure in the specific position under consideration 
and about the tenure policies and practices in their departments and institutions. If the information is not offered, 
candidates are urged to inquire about these policies.

Acknowledgment of Applications

Acting on a recommendation from the MLA Delegate Assembly, the MLA Executive Council has adopted a policy 
calling for departments to acknowledge all applications for announced positions.

MLA Policy on the Reimbursement of Job Seekers

The following policies were recommended by the Delegate Assembly in December 1999 and approved by the MLA 
Executive Council in February 2000.

It is MLA policy that

 • departments that require that job applicants send their application materials by express carrier reimburse those 
applicants for the cost of such shipment; and



ii MLA JOB INFORMATION LIST • ENGLISH EDITION • December 2012

 • departments that require multiple copies of writing samples and other application materials from job applicants 
reimburse applicants for the cost of duplicating their writing samples and other materials; and

 • departments that require books will return them to the applicant; and

 • departments that invite job applicants for on-campus interviews reimburse those applicants who accept such 
invitations for the costs of travel and accommodations incurred when visiting the campus for interviews.



MLA Annual Convention

The annual convention of the Modern Language Association will be held in Boston, 3–6 January 2013. The Job Information Center 
will be located in the American Ballroom, 4th floor, Westin Copley Place, for both English and foreign languages. Job candidates, 
departmental administrators, and representatives who wish to use the facilities of the Job Information Center must be registered for the 
convention. The following services will be provided:

1. MLA Convention Location Information. Information about interview locations at the annual convention can now 
be submitted online in advance of and during the convention, so interviewers no longer have to come to the 
Job Information Center in person unless they are interviewing there. The information is used by MLA staff 
members at the Job Information Center to help individual job seekers who have scheduled interviews find the 
location of their interviews; it is not made available online, and job seekers are not permitted to browse interview 
location information in any form. Interviewers can log in with their department ID and two-letter JIL 
submission password at www.mla.org/jil_dept and provide any of the following information to help scheduled 
interviewees locate the interview and, if necessary, contact the interview team: location of interviews (either 
the interview area at the Job Information Center or a hotel, including room number), name of interviewer(s), 
and cell phone number of interviewer(s). Interviewers who do not submit their information online must come 
to the Job Information Center to provide the information. Interviewers using the interview area at the Job 
Information Center must come to the interview area in person to have a table assigned. The sign-in desk will 
be open from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on 3 January, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on 4 and 5 January, and from 
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon on 6 January. 

2. Interview Area. For the convenience of departmental representatives and candidates, there will be an interview 
area for English and foreign languages within the Job Information Center. Interviewers who wish to use this 
area should schedule their own interviews either by letter before the convention or by leaving messages at the 
message center. Table assignments in the interview area, which will be open from 8:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m. on 
3 January, from 8:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. on 4 and 5 January, and from 8:00 a.m. until 12:00 noon on 6 January, 
will be given to departmental representatives on a first-come, first-served basis. MLA staff members will be 
on duty in the area to assist interviewers and candidates.

3. Counseling Service. The Job Information Center counseling service affords job seekers the opportunity to discuss 
individual employment problems with experienced department administrators. Although counselors cannot 
help candidates obtain interviews, they can and will offer objective, concrete advice on such matters as the 
appropriate content and presentation of vitae and letters of application, the kinds of institutions to which candidates 
might most profitably apply, and realistic approaches to job interviews. Counselors will be on hand at 
the center to speak with interested candidates starting at 8:45 a.m. on 4 and 5 January. Appointments can be 
arranged through the staff member on duty in the interview area of the job center.

4. Vacancy Notices. A list of job openings received too late to be included 
in the December Job Information List 
will be posted on bulletin 
boards in the Job Information Center. Departmental representatives who have last-
minute vacancies should submit detailed descriptions of these to an MLA staff member in the center, who will 
see that they are posted on the boards. Such notices may also appear in the February Job Information List so that 
candidates who do not attend the convention will have an opportunity to apply.

Although every effort will be made to assist candidates and interviewers in the Job Information Center, it should be noted 
that the MLA does not have the facilities for introducing candidates and interviewers who have not corresponded before the convention.

There is very little open interviewing at the convention. Job candidates who do not have prearranged interviews 
should not plan to attend for the sole purpose of seeking employment.

List of Administrations Censured

by the American Association of University Professors

Note: The following list and accompanying explanatory note are reprinted from Academe by permission of the American Association 
of University Professors and in accordance with the action of the MLA Delegate Assembly. 

Investigations by the American Association of University Professors of the administrations of the institutions listed 
below show that, as evidenced by a past violation, they are not observing the generally recognized principles of 
academic freedom and tenure endorsed by this Association, the Association of American Colleges and Universities, 
and more than 150 other professional and educational organizations. The 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic 
Freedom and Tenure may be found in the May-June 1990 issue of Academe.

This list is published for the purpose of informing Association members, the profession at large, and the public that 
unsatisfactory conditions of academic freedom and tenure have been found to prevail at these institutions. Names 
are placed on or removed from this censure list by vote of the Association’s Annual Meeting.

Placing the name of an institution on this list does not mean that censure is visited either upon the whole of the 
institution or upon the faculty, but specifically upon its present administration. The term “administration” includes 
the administrative officers and the governing board of the institution. This censure does not affect the eligibility of 
nonmembers for membership in the Association, nor does it affect the individual rights of members at the institution 
in question.

Members of the Association have often considered it to be their duty, in order to indicate their support of the principles 
violated, 
to refrain from accepting appointment to an institution so long as it remains on the censure list. Since 
circumstances differ widely from case to case, the Association does not assert that such an unqualified obligation 
exists for its members; it does urge that, before accepting appointments, they seek information on present conditions 
of academic freedom and tenure from the Association’s Washington office and prospective departmental colleagues. 
The Association leaves it to the discretion 
of the individual, possessed of the facts, to make the proper decision.

The censured administrations, with dates of censuring, are listed below. Reports were published as indicated by the Bulletin 
or Academe citations in parentheses following each listing. Reference should also be made to “Developments Relating 
to Censure by the Association” and to the “Report of Committee A,” each of which appears annually in Academe.

we seek a writer of fiction to teach two semesters at The George Washington University as the Jenny McKean 
Moore Writer-in-Washington. The successful candidate will teach a small fiction workshop each semester for 
members of the metropolitan Washington community. No tuition is charged for these workshops, which are not 
open to University students. The successful candidate will also teach two classes, one each semester, for students 
at The George Washington University. This position is funded by an endowment from the Jenny McKean Moore 
Fund for Writers. The late Jenny McKean Moore, who had been a playwriting student at The George Washington 
University, left in trust a fund to encourage creative writing, and the trustees of the Fund helped design the 
program. The position is intended to serve as a fellowship for the visiting writer, since it involves only a moderate 
teaching load. The program's location at a university in the center of Washington should offer additional attractions 
for the writer. Basic Qualifications: The writer must have significant publications (including a book of fiction published 
by a well-regarded press) and experience teaching, though not necessarily in a conventional academic setting. 
The writer need not have conventional academic credentials. He or she should reside in the Washington area while 
the University is in session, 1 September through early May. Campus housing is normally available to the writer 
through a subsidized rental agreement. The salary for 2013–2014 is expected to be $58,000 plus an attractive benefits 
package. Application Procedure: To be considered, complete an online faculty application at http:// www .gwu .jobs/ postings/ 11352 and upload a cover letter, a 20–30 page writing sample, a resume that includes a full list of

The University of Wisconsin-Madison Mellon Postdoctoral Program invites recent PhDs to apply for its three two-
year postdoctoral fellowships. The theme for 2013–15 applicants is “Democracy.”

We invite scholars to reflect upon democracy as a focus of historical, philosophical, literary, cultural, or aesthetic 
analysis. We seek projects that consider democracy from within the humanities and that understand democracy as 
concept, practice, or mode with bearing on politics, law, and society, as well as literature, language, and the arts. 
Democracy—whether conceived as the legitimation of power or its exercise, as “the reign of the limitless desire of 
individuals in modern mass society” or the opening of politics and society to a plurality of voices—is at once contested 
and coveted. Democracy is implicated in nationalism and cosmopolitanism, war and peace, justice and reconciliation, 
and freedom and enslavement, that is, who is included in or left out of the social contract and civic life.

Complete information about the fellowship, the competition theme, qualifications, and application requirements is 
available at our website. All application materials, including reference letters, must be submitted by November 20, 
2012 to receive full consideration.
