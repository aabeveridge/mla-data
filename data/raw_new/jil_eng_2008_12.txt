Accessing the Electronic JIL 

All access to search the online version of the Job Information List is now through membership in 
either the Association of Departments of English (ADE) or the Association of Departments of Foreign 
Languages (ADFL). 

Access to search the JIL is free to graduate students and faculty members in departments that 
are members of the ADE or the ADFL. If your department is a member, it can provide you with 
the department ID and password to log in at the ADE or ADFL Web site. When you log in, you 
will be asked to create your own personal login information for searching the JIL at that site. 

MLA members in ADE- and ADFL-member departments can also log in to search the JIL at 
the MLA Web site with their MLA-member user name and password. No additional user name or 
password is required. 

Individuals without an academic affiliation or whose departments are not currently members of 
the ADE or the ADFL can access the JIL by becoming affiliate members of the ADE or the ADFL. 
Like students and faculty members in ADE- and ADFL-member departments, ADE and ADFL affiliate 
members receive access to the online archive of the ADE or the ADFL Bulletins as well as 
rights to search the JIL database over the Internet. (Print versions of the JIL are no longer available 
to individuals.) Dues for affiliate memberships are $40 for MLA members and $65 for nonmembers 
and are refundable on request to those whose departments become members of the ADE or the 
ADFL within the membership period, which runs from September to August. Affiliate memberships 
must be purchased online with a credit card and are for the use of a single individual only.

Information for Candidates 

In This Issue 

The December issue contains notices describing approximately 340 definite and possible positions. Readers should note that departments 
are not encouraged to repeat listings that have appeared in the October issue. If a notice published in the October JIL does not 
reappear 
in this issue, readers should not assume that the position is no longer available. The only reliable guide to application is to 
check the deadline reported in the original notice or a current announcement in this List. 

Guide for Using the Job Information List 

US and Canadian Departments 

The main body of the List, arranged in alphabetical order by state, 
contains information on definite or possible vacancies and notices from 
departments that expect no vacancies but would nevertheless like to 
keep résumés on file. 

Read through this section item by item to see which departments 
would welcome your letter of application or inquiry at this time. Send 
letters only to departments expressing an interest in a person with your 
qualifications. If a notice states that no vacancies are expected but that 
the department would like to maintain a file of prospective candidates, 
you must decide in each case whether it is worthwhile to write. 

Comparative Literature and Linguistics and ESL Sections 

Notices in these fields have been separated out from the main body 
of the issue and placed under the appropriate heading. 

General Advice for Candidates 

Be sure that your dossier (transcript, letters of recommendation, and 
other material) is ready to be sent out by your placement bureau to 
any department that requests it. Prepare and duplicate a one-page vita 
sheet to enclose with any letters of application or inquiry. In your letter 
of application, it is probably wise to express a willingness to be interviewed 
at the department’s convenience. Professional meetings provide 
a convenient opportunity for such interviews (see MLA convention 
information on pp. ii–iii). 

While it is important to begin to search for a position immediately, 
you should be aware that hiring goes on all year. Surveys indicate that 
only about half of all English and foreign language departments have 
begun recruiting by the end of December and that the majority of departments 
do not complete the recruiting process until spring, in some 
cases until summer. 

Bear in mind that the candidate who has not limited his or her 
search for a new position to a particular geographical area or kind of 
institution is most likely to find a position. Do not discount the small 
colleges where one often has the opportunity to teach a wide selection 
of courses to students of varied backgrounds. 

Notice on Tenure Policies 

The Modern Language Association recommends that department 
administrators and their representatives inform candidates before or 
during the interview about prospects for tenure in the specific position 
under consideration and about the tenure policies and practices in their 
departments and institutions. If the information is not offered, candidates 
are urged to inquire about these policies. 

Acknowledgment of Applications 

Acting on a recommendation from the MLA Delegate Assembly, the 
MLA Executive Council has adopted a policy calling for departments 
to acknowledge all applications for announced positions either by letter 
or by self-addressed postcards provided by applicants. 

MLA Policy on the Reimbursement of Job Seekers 

The following policies were recommended by the Delegate Assembly 
in December 1999 and approved by the MLA Executive Council 
in February 2000. 

It is MLA policy that: 

 • Departments that require that job applicants send their application 
materials by express carrier reimburse those applicants for the cost 
of such shipment; and 

 • Departments that require multiple copies of writing samples and 
other application materials from job applicants reimburse applicants 
for the cost of duplicating their writing samples and other 
materials; and 

 • Departments that require books will return them to the applicant; 
and 

 • Departments that invite job applicants for on-campus interviews 
reimburse those applicants who accept such invitations for the 
costs of travel and accommodations incurred when visiting the 
campus for interviews.

MLA Annual Convention 

The Annual Convention of the Modern Language Association will be held in San Francisco, 27–30 December 2008. The Job 
Information 
Center will be located in the Terrace Room, Terrace level, of the Fairmont San Francisco Hotel, for both English and 
foreign languages. Job candidates, 
departmental administrators, and representatives who wish to use the facilities of the 
Job Information Center must be registered for the convention. The following services will be provided: 

(1) Interviewer’s Sign-In Desk for Departments. Departmental administrators 
or representatives 
who plan to hold job interviews during the 
convention, whether in their own hotel rooms or in the Interview Area 
of the Job Information Center, should sign in (name, institution, hotel, 
and room number) at the Job Information Center, so that candidates 
with whom they have set up interviews will be able to locate 
them. Although an interviewer’s 
name may appear in “Who’s 
Where,” for security reasons hotel switchboards will not give out 
guests’ room numbers—and are in any case extremely busy. A 
brief stop at the sign-in desk by a thoughtful 
interviewer can save 
much confusion and worry for candidates. The sign-in desk will 
be open from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on 27 December, from 8:00 
a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on 28 December, from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on 
29 December, and from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon on 30 December. 
There will be no telephone interview location service. 

(2) Counseling Service. The Job Information Center counseling service 
affords job seekers the opportunity to discuss individual employment 
problems with experienced department administrators. Although 
counselors cannot help candidates obtain interviews, they 
can and will offer objective, concrete advice on such matters as the 
appropriate content and presentation of vitae and letters of application, 
the kinds of institutions to which candidates might most profitably 
apply, and realistic approaches to job interviews. Counselors 
will be on hand at the center to speak with interested candidates 
from 10:15 a.m. until 5:15 p.m. on 28 and 29 December. Appointments 
can be arranged through the staff member on duty in the 
interview area of the job center. 

(3) Interview Area. For the convenience of departmental representatives 
and candidates, there will be an interview area for English and foreign 
languages within the Job Information Center. Interviewers who 
wish to use this area should schedule their own interviews either by 
letter before the convention or by leaving messages at the message 
center. Table assignments in the interview area, which will be open 
from 12:00 noon until 8:00 p.m. on 27 December, from 8:00 a.m. 
until 8:00 p.m. on 28 December, from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. on 
29 December, and from 9:00 a.m. until 12:00 noon on 30 December, 
will be given to departmental representatives on a first-come, 
first-served basis. MLA staff members will be on duty in the area to 
assist interviewers and candidates. 

(4) Vacancy Notices. A list of job openings received too late to be 
included 
in the December Job Information List will be posted on 
bulletin 
boards in the Job Information Center. Departmental representatives 
who have last-minute vacancies should submit detailed 
descriptions of these to an MLA staff member in the center, who 
will see that they are posted on the boards. Such notices may also 
appear in the February Job Information List so that candidates who 
do not attend the convention will have an opportunity to apply. 

(5) Message Center. Open from 12:00 noon until 8:00 p.m. on 27 December, 
from 8:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. on 28 December, from 9:00 a.m. 
to 6:00 p.m. on 29 December, and from 9:00 a.m. until 11:30 a.m. 
on 30 December, the message center will help candidates and interviewers 
who have corresponded before the convention establish 
specific interview times and places. The message center will not be 
useful to those who leave messages at random for persons who may 
not even be in attendance at the convention. Such messages are not 
picked up, and they serve only to defeat the purpose of the center. 

Although every effort will be made to assist candidates and interviewers 
in the Job Information Center, it should be noted that the MLA does not 
have the facilities for introducing candidates and interviewers who have not corresponded 
before the convention. 

There is very little open interviewing at the convention. Job 
candidates who do not have prearranged interviews should 
not plan to attend for the sole purpose of seeking employment.

List of Administrations Censured 

by the American Association of University Professors 

Note: The following list and accompanying explanatory note are reprinted from Academe by permission of the American Association 
of University Professors and in accordance with the action of the MLA Delegate Assembly. 

Investigations by the American Association of University Professors of the 
administrations of the institutions listed below show that, as evidenced by a 
past violation, they are not observing the generally recognized principles of 
academic freedom and tenure endorsed by this Association, the Association of 
American Colleges and Universities, and more than 150 other professional and 
educational organizations. The 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom 
and Tenure may be found in the May-June 1990 issue of Academe. 

This list is published for the purpose of informing Association members, the 
profession at large, and the public that unsatisfactory conditions of academic 
freedom and tenure have been found to prevail at these institutions. Names are 
placed on or removed from this censure list by vote of the Association’s Annual 
Meeting. 

Placing the name of an institution on this list does not mean that censure 
is visited either upon the whole of the institution or upon the faculty, but specifically 
upon its present administration. The term “administration” includes the 
administrative officers and the governing board of the institution. This censure 
does not affect the eligibility of nonmembers for membership in the Association, 
nor does it affect the individual rights of members at the institution in 
question. 

Members of the Association have often considered it to be their duty, in 
order to indicate their support of the principles violated, 
to refrain from accepting 
appointment to an institution so long as it remains on the censure list. Since 
circumstances differ widely from case to case, the Association does not assert 
that such an unqualified obligation exists for its members; it does urge that, 
before accepting appointments, they seek information on present conditions 
of academic freedom and tenure from the Association’s Washington office and 
prospective departmental colleagues. The Association leaves it to the discretion 
of the individual, possessed of the facts, to make the proper decision. 

The censured administrations, with dates of censuring, are listed below. Reports 
were published as indicated by the Bulletin or Academe citations in parentheses 
following each listing. Reference should also be made to “Developments 
Relating to Censure by the Association” and to the “Report of Committee A,” 
each of which appears annually in Academe.

Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowships in the Humanities 4929 

http:// www .humanities@ utoronto .ca 

The Jackman Humanities Institute at the University of Toronto is pleased 
to announce Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowships. Up to three 
Fellows in the Humanities will be selected for a two-year fellowship on 
the basis of accomplishment, promise of excellence, and relevance of their 
research to the annual theme, Pressures on the Human. 

Today humanists must contend with a fundamental question: Is the object 
of our scholarship-Humanity-still a valid category? This question arises 
from pressures that challenge the distinctions that make us human beings. 
Some of these pressures arise from science, medicine, and technology: 
how are we to understand the distinction of being human when our 
physical activities can be recognized as part of animal biology, when our 
physical make-up is governed by the biochemistry of DNA, when our 
mental capacities are interwoven with those of computers and artificial 
intelligence? Can progress in medicine and technology replace the various 
functions that have historically and theoretically made the human distinct? 
Using various approaches to study the artistic and scholarly records 
of the past and present, humanities scholars explore these pressures. 

Fellowships begin on 1 July 2009. Email materials to humanities@ chass 
.utoronto.ca by Monday 1 December 2008. For submission guidelines and 
further details, see http:// www .humanities .utoronto .ca/proposals .html. 
Awards will be announced in March 2009. 

1. A 2–4 page letter of application, including a statement of current research 
interests related to the theme Pressures on the Human, outlining 
the research to be undertaken during the term of the Fellowship. 

2. A full C.V. 

3. Three letters of recommendation to be submitted directly by your referees 
(candidates should arrange to have these letters sent electronically by 
the deadline). 

4. Copies of published work, extracts from dissertation, or drafts of work 
in progress (not to exceed 25–30 pages). 

5. A 2–4 page statement of teaching interests including course proposals.
