ACCESSING THE ELECTRONIC JIL 

An online version of the Job Information List is available for searching by individuals who have subscribed 
to the electronic JIL as well as by job seekers in ADE- and ADFL-member departments. A 
user name and password are required to search the database. To find your user name 
and password, follow these directions: 

If you are an individual subscriber: If you already have a user name and password, use them. If you 
do not, you may retrieve them online at the MLA Web site (www.mla.org). Follow the link to the 
JIL page and click on the appropriate “Search” button; when the password prompt appears, scroll 
down and enter your e-mail address in the appropriate box and click “E-mail me.” Your user 
name and password will be sent to the e-mail address that you specified when you subscribed. You 
have the option to change your user name and password whenever you choose by logging in at 
the JIL page and then clicking the “Subscriber Information” button at the top of the search form 
and following the instructions for changing your user name and password. 

If you are a job seeker in an ADE- or ADFL-member department: Graduate students and faculty 
members in departments that are current paid members of ADE or ADFL have access to the online 
JIL as a benefit of their department’s ADE or ADFL membership. You must access the JIL through 
the ADE or ADFL home pages (www.ade.org; www.adfl.org). Information on how to access the 
online JIL on this basis is available from your department chair. 


INFORMATION FOR CANDIDATES 


In This Issue 

The December issue contains notices describing approximately 500 definite and possible positions. Readers should note that departments 
are not encouraged to repeat listings that have appeared in the October issue. If a notice published in the October JIL does not 
reappear in this issue, readers should not assume that the position is no longer available. The only reliable guide to application is to 
check the deadline reported in the original notice or a current announcement in this List. 

Guide for Using the Job Information List 

US and Canadian Departments 

The main body of the List, arranged in alphabetical order by state, 
contains information on definite or possible vacancies and notices from 
departments that expect no vacancies but would nevertheless like to 
keep résumés on file. 

Read through this section item by item to see which departments 
would welcome your letter of application or inquiry at this time. Send 
letters only to departments expressing an interest in a person with your 
qualifications. If a notice states that no vacancies are expected but that 
the department would like to maintain a file of prospective candidates, 
you must decide in each case whether it is worthwhile to write. 

Comparative Literature and Linguistics and ESL Sections 

Notices in these fields have been separated out from the main body 
of the issue and placed under the appropriate heading. 

General Advice for Candidates 

Be sure that your dossier (transcript, letters of recommendation, and 
other material) is ready to be sent out by your placement bureau to any 
department that requests it. Prepare and duplicate a one-page vita sheet 
to enclose with any letters of application or inquiry. In your letter of 
application, it is probably wise to express a willingness to be interviewed 
at the department’s convenience. Professional meetings provide 
a convenient opportunity for such interviews (see MLA convention information 
on p. iii). 

While it is important to begin to search for a position immediately, 
you should be aware that hiring goes on all year. Surveys indicate that 
only about half of all English and foreign language departments have 
begun recruiting by the end of December and that the majority of departments 
do not complete the recruiting process until spring, in some 
cases until summer. 

Bear in mind that the candidate who has not limited his or her 
search for a new position to a particular geographical area or kind of 
institution is most likely to find a position. Do not discount the small 
colleges where one often has the opportunity to teach a wide selection 
of courses to students of varied backgrounds. 

Notice on Tenure Policies 

The Modern Language Association recommends that department 
administrators and their representatives infor m candidates before or 
during the interview about prospects for tenure in the specific position 
under consideration and about the tenure policies and practices in their 
departments and institutions. If the information is not offered, candidates 
are urged to inquire about these policies. 

Acknowledgment of Applications 

Acting on a recommendation from the MLA Delegate Assembly, 
the MLA Executive Council has adopted a policy calling for departments 
to acknowledge all applications for announced positions either 
by letter or by self-addressed postcards provided by applicants. 

MLA Policy on the Reimbursement of Job Seekers 

The following policies were recommended by the Delegate Assembly 
in December 1999 and approved by the MLA Executive Council 
in February 2000. 

It is MLA policy that: 

• Departments that require that job applicants send their application 
materials by express carrier reimburse those applicants for the cost 
of such shipment; and 
• Departments that require multiple copies of writing samples and 
other application materials from job applicants reimburse applicants 
for the cost of duplicating their wr iting samples and other 
materials; and 
• Departments that require books will return them to the applicant; 
and 
• Departments that invite job applicants for on-campus interviews 
reimburse those applicants who accept such invitations for the 
costs of travel and accommodations incurred when visiting the 
campus for interviews.

MLA Guide to the Job Search 

The MLA Guide to the Job Search (New York: MLA, 1997) contains 
much useful information and advice to assist candidates in organizing 
their job searches confidently and competently. Copies of the Guide are 

available to JIL subscribers for $5.00 and no shipping and handling 
charge. The regular price of the Guide is $10.00 ($8.00 for MLA 
members), plus $3.00 for shipping and handling. To order a copy, 
write, enclosing a check, to MLA Member and Customer Services, 26 
Broadway, 3rd floor, New York, NY 10004-1789.

MLA ANNUAL CONVENTION 


The Annual Convention of the Modern Language Association will be held in Washington, DC, 27–30 December 2005. The Job 
Information Center will be located in the Ambassador Ballroom of the Omni Shoreham Hotel, for both English and foreign 
languages. Job candidates, departmental administrators, and representatives who wish to use the facilities of the Job 
Information Center must be registered for the convention. The following services will be provided: 

(1) Interviewer’s Sign-In Desk for Departments. Departmental administrators 
or representatives who plan to hold job interviews during the 
convention, whether in their own hotel rooms or in the Interview Area of 
the Job Information Center, should sign in (name, institution, hotel, 
and room number) at the Job Information Center, so that candidates 
with whom they have set up interviews will be able to locate 
them. Although an interviewer’s name may appear in “Who’s 
Where,” for security reasons hotel switchboards will not give out 
guests’ room numbers—and are in any case extremely busy.Abrief 
stop at the sign-in desk by a thoughtful interviewer can save much 
confusion and worry for candidates. The sign-in desk will be open 
from 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on 27 December, from 8:00 a.m. to 
8:00 p.m. on 28 December, from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on 29 
December, and from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon on 30 December. 
There will be no telephone interview location service. 
(2) Counseling Service. The Job Information Center counseling service 
affords job seekers the opportunity to discuss individual employment 
problems with exper ienced department administrators. Although 
counselors cannot help candidates obtain interviews, they 
can and will offer objective, concrete advice on such matters as the 
appropriate content and presentation of vitae and letters of application, 
the kinds of institutions to which candidates might most profitably 
apply, and realistic approaches to job interviews. Counselors 
will be on hand at the center to speak with interested candidates 
from 10:15 a.m. until 5:15 p.m. on 28 and 29 December. Appointments 
can be arranged through the staff member on duty in the interview 
area of the job center. 
(3) Interview Area. For the convenience of departmental representatives 
and candidates, there will be an interview area for English and foreign 
languages within the Job Information Center. Interviewers who 
wish to use this area should schedule their own interviews either by 
letter before the convention or by leaving messages at the message 
center. Table assignments in the interview area, which will be open 
from 12:00 noon until 8:00 p.m. on 27 December, from 8:00 a.m. 
until 8:00 p.m. on 28 December, from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. on 
29 December, and from 9:00 a.m. until 12:00 noon on 30 December, 
will be given to departmental representatives on a first-come, 
first-served basis. MLA staff members will be on duty in the area to 
assist interviewers and candidates. 
(4) Vacancy Notices. A list of job openings received too late to be 
included in the December Job Information List will be posted on 
bulletin boards in the Job Information Center. Departmental representatives 
who have last-minute vacancies should submit detailed 
descriptions of these to an MLA staff member in the center, who 
will see that they are posted on the boards. Such notices may also 
appear in the February Job Information List so that candidates who 
do not attend the convention will have an opportunity to apply. 
(5) Message Center. Open from 12:00 noon until 8:00 p.m. on 27 December, 
from 8:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. on 28 December, from 9:00 a.m. 
to 6:00 p.m. on 29 December, and from 9:00 a.m. until 11:30 a.m. 
on 30 December, the message center will help candidates and interviewers 
who have corresponded before the convention establish 
specific interview times and places. The message center will not be 
useful to those who leave messages at random for persons who may 
not even be in attendance at the convention. Such messages are not 
picked up, and they serve only to defeat the purpose of the center. 
Although every effort will be made to assist candidates and interviewers 
in the Job Information Center, it should be noted that the MLA does 
not have the facilities for introducing candidates and interviewers who have not 
corresponded before the convention. 

THERE IS VERY LITTLE OPEN INTERVIEWING AT THE CONVENTION. 
JOB CANDIDATES WHO DO NOT HAVE PREARRANGED INTERVIEWS 
SHOULD NOT PLAN TO ATTEND FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SEEKING 
EMPLOYMENT.

LIST OF ADMINISTRATIONS CENSURED 


BY THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS 

Note: The following list and accompanying explanatory note are reprinted from Academe by permission of the American 
Association of University Professors and in accordance with the action of the MLA Delegate Assembly. 

Investigations by the American Association of University Professors of the 
administrations of the institutions listed below show that, as evidenced by a past 
violation, they are not observing the generally recognized pr inciples of academic 
freedom and tenure endorsed by this Association, the Association of 
American Colleges and Universities, and more than 150 other professional and 
educational organizations. The 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom 
and Tenure may be found in the May-June 1990 issue of Academe. 

This list is published for the purpose of infor ming Association members, 
the profession at large, and the public that unsatisfactory conditions of academic 
freedom and tenure have been found to prevail at these institutions. 
Names are placed on or removed from this censure list by vote of the Association’s 
Annual Meeting. 

Placing the name of an institution on this list does not mean that censure is 
visited either upon the whole of the institution or upon the faculty, but specifically 
upon its present administration. The term “administration” includes the 
administrative officers and the governing board of the institution. This censure 

does not affect the eligibility of nonmembers for membership in the Association, 
nor does it affect the individual rights of members at the institution in question. 

Members of the Association have often considered it to be their duty, in 
order to indicate their support of the principles violated, to refrain from accepting 
appointment to an institution so long as it remains on the censure list. 
Since circumstances differ widely from case to case, the Association does not 
assert that such an unqualified obligation exists for its members; it does urge 
that, before accepting appointments, they seek information on present conditions 
of academic freedom and tenure from the Association’s Washington office 
and prospective departmental colleagues. The Association leaves it to the discretion 
of the individual, possessed of the facts, to make the proper decision. 

The censured administrations, with dates of censuring, are listed below. 
Reports were published as indicated by the Bulletin or Academe citations in 
parentheses following each listing. Reference should also be made to “Developments 
Relating to Censure by the Association” and to the “Report of Committee 
A,” each of which appears annually in Academe.

Chair, Reader, Senior Lecturer, Lecturer, Research Fellow 
The Centre for Modern Thought at the University of Aberdeen has been cre


ated as a site for cross-disciplinary theoretical research and theoretical inquiry 
bearing on global socio-historical developments and political issues. It will serve 
degree programs throughout the College of Art and Social Sciences in the context 
of the University’s new Graduate School and will offer a stimulating environment 
to students seeking a high-profile Ph.D. program staffed by 
internationally recognized scholars. 

In the coming academic year, we aim to make a number of academic appoint


ments (at any rank) in the following areas: 
Modern Intellectual History: We seek a scholar whose work entails the capacity 
to address representations of history in the modern period, including Hegelian or 
Marxist models, and more contemporary “post-structuralist” elaborations. This 
individual could come from fields such as philosophy, literature, history, or sociology, 
but should have a strong interest in philosophy of history. 

Science Studies/History of Science: An important part of the Centre’s work will 
be addressed to relations between the sciences, the social sciences and the humanities. 
An individual strongly versed in the areas of history of science and theory 
of knowledge will play a vital role. 

Theory of Art: We intend to establish strong links between the Centre for Modern 
Thought, the program in Art History, the Centre for Visual Culture, and 
initiatives underway in Aberdeen. A suitable candidate might come from a variety 
of fields, including architecture, film, art history, or the performing arts. We 
would also consider candidates whose work combines theoretical inquiry and 
practice. 

Political Theory: The Centre’s ambition of addressing issues of broad socio-political 
import will be served by an individual with significant preparation in political 
economy and modern political theory. 

Literary Theory: We seek a scholar with a strong capacity to address the questions 
posed to modern thought by literature. This individual should be well 
versed in modern continental philosophy and might also bring a special interest 
in psychoanalytic theory. 

Scholars from any field whose work intersects with these areas are welcome to 
apply. Suitable candidates will have a distinguished publication record or demonstrate 
exceptional promise. We will accept applications until the positions are 
filled, but we will begin active consideration of the applications on 15 November 
2005. Enquiries may be directed to Professor Christopher Fynsk,

Deadline: February 1, 2006 
The division of humanities at the University of California, Los Angeles, will ap


point four Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellows for a 2-year tenure begin


ning in the fall of 2006. Fellows must have earned their doctoral degree no earlier 
than January 2000 and no later than June 2006. The Mellon Fellowship provides 
a stipend of $45,000 a year, standard fringe benefits, a one-time moving 
allowance of $1,500, plus a small research budget of $1,000. All Fellows will be 
housed in relevant home departments for which they teach two courses each 
year. They are required to be in residence and to participate in the monthly Mellon 
Fellows Seminars and annual Mellon Conference, as well as the on-going intellectual 
life of their home departments. Fellows will also write a progress report 
due on June 15th of each year of residence. 

The Mellon program at UCLA is designed to explore the emerging field of 
Transnational Studies. Its aim is to broaden the study of minority cultures from 
its national focus to global and comparative perspectives. We seek innovative 
scholarship that explores minority cultures as major components of world culture 
and history, generated by immigrant and minority writers, artists, filmmakers, 
playwrights, and musicians residing in metropolitan centers across the world and 
thereby reshaping the canons of literature, art, and music in their respective 
countries. The program encourages the investigation of such patterns of encounter 
over several centuries in order better to understand what is distinctive 
about each period and in each field of research. 

There is no application form. Applicants should send a cover letter, a description 
(no more than 1500 words) of the scholarly project relevant to the program, a 
CV, and three letters of recommendation by February 1, 2006, to: Mellon Postdoctoral 
Fellowships in the Humanities at UCLA, Royce Humanities Group, 
212 Royce Hall, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095. The program is co-chaired by

Job Clinic at the 2005 Convention 

http://www.mla.org 
A Job Clinic for MLA members interested in employment outside the academy 
will be held at the 2005 convention in Washington, DC. The Clinic will again 
be conducted by Howard Figler, career consultant, author (“The Complete Job 
Search Handbook”), and former director of the career center at the University of 
Texas at Austin. The twenty one previous clinics have been enthusiastically received 
by participants. The first job clinic was held at the 1984 convention. One 
participant praised a previous clinic for being “very well organized, reasonably 
priced.” Another observed, “I feel that I now have a concrete picture of available 
opportunities and practical approaches to the job search. Dr. Figler really helped 
build my confidence and change my frame of mind to a more positive attitude. I 
especially appreciated that Dr. Figler’s own background and the slant given to the 
seminar wre pertinent to my own specific situation as an academic in transition.” 
The clinic will assist in learning about career options and marketable skills, 
preparing effective resumes, locating jobs, and improving interviewing and negotiation 
skills. It will consist of five sessions that begin at 4:00 p.m. on 26 December 
(one day before the formal opening of the convention) and conclude at 
noon on 28 December. There should be minimal conflict with other convention 
sessions. The cost is $215 in addition to the convention registration fee;enrollment 
is limited. To receive further particulars, write or e-mail (rchustek@mla
