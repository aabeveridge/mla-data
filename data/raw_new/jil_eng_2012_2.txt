Infor mation for Candidates 


In This Issue 

The February issue contains notices describing approximately 390 definite and possible positions. 

Guide for Using the Job Information List 

US and Canadian Departments 

The main body of the List, arranged in alphabetical order by language, 
contains information on def inite or possible vacancies and 
notices from departments that expect no vacancies but would nevertheless 
like to keep vitae on file. 

Read through this section item by item to see which departments 
would welcome your letter of application or inquir y at this time. Send 
letters only to departments expressing an interest in a person with your 
qualifications. If a notice states that no vacancies are expected but that 
the depar tment would like to maintain a fi le of prospective candidates, 
you must decide in each case whether it is worthwhile to write. 

Comparative Literature and Linguistics and ESL Sections 

Notices in these fields have been separated from the main body of 
the issue and placed under the appropriate heading. 

General Advice for Candidates 

Be sure that your dossier (transcript, letters of recommendation, 
and other material) is ready to be sent out by your placement bureau 
to any department that requests it. Prepare and duplicate a one-page 
vita to enclose with any letters of application or inquir y. In your letter 
of application, it is probably wise to express a wil lingness to be 
interviewed at the department’s convenience. Professional meetings 
provide a convenient oppor tunit y for such inter views (see MLA 
convention information on pp. ii–iii). 

While it is important to beg in to search for a position im mediately, 
you should be aware that hiring goes on all year. Surveys indicate 
that only about half of all English and foreign language departments 
have begun recruiting by the end of December and that the majority 
of departments do not complete the recruiting process until spring, 
in some cases until summer. 

Bear in m ind that the candidate who has not limited his or her 
search for a new position to a particular geographic area or kind of 
institution is most likely to find a position. Do not discount the small 
colleges, where one often has the opportunity to teach a wide selection 
of courses to students of varied backgrounds. 

Notice on Tenure Policies 

The Modern Language Association recommends that department 
administrators and their representatives inform candidates before or 
during the interview about prospects for tenure in the specific position 
under consideration and about the tenure policies and practices 
in their departments and institutions. If the information is not offered, 
candidates are urged to inquire about these policies. 

Acknowledgment of Applications 

Acting on a recommendation from the MLA Delegate Assembly, 
the MLA Executive Council has adopted a policy calling for departments 
to acknowledge all applications for announced positions either 
by letter or by self-addressed postcards provided by applicants. 

MLA Policy on the Reimbursement of Job Seekers 

The following policies were recommended by the Delegate Assembly 
in December 1999 and approved by the M LA Execut ive 
Council in February 2000. 

It is MLA policy that: 

• 
Departments that require that job applicants send their application 
materials by express carrier reimburse those applicants for 
the cost of such shipment; and 
• 
Departments that require multiple copies of writing samples and 
other application materials from job applicants reimburse applicants 
for the cost of duplicating their writing samples and other 
materials; and 
• 
Departments that require books will return them to the applicant; 
and 
• 
Departments that invite job applicants for on-campus interviews 
reimburse those applicants who accept such invitations for the 
costs of travel and accommodations incurred when visiting the 
campus for inter views. 
MLA JOB INFORMATION LIST 


List of Administrations Censured 


by the American Association of University Professors 

Note: The following list and accompanying explanatory note are reprinted from Academe by permission of the American 
Association of University Professors and in accordance with the action of the MLA Delegate Assembly. 

Investigations by the American Association of University Professors of 
the administrations of the institutions listed below show that, as evidenced by 
a past violation, they are not observing the generally recognized principles of 
academic freedom and tenure endorsed by this Association, the Association 
of American Colleges and Universities, and more than 150 other professional 
and educational organizations. The 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic 
Freedom and Tenure may be found in the May-June 1990 issue of Academe. 

This list is published for the purpose of informing Association members, 
the profession at large, and the public that unsatisfactory conditions of academic 
freedom and tenure have been found to prevail at these institutions. 
Names are placed on or removed from this censure list by vote of the Association’s 
Annual Meeting. 

Placing the name of an institution on this list does not mean that censure 
is visited either upon the whole of the institution or upon the faculty, but 
specifically upon its present administration. The term “administration” includes 
the administrative officers and the governing board of the institution. 
This censure does not affect the eligibility of nonmembers for membership 

in the Association, nor does it affect the individual rights of members at the 
institution in question. 

Members of the Association have often considered it to be their dut y, 
in order to indicate their support of the principles violated, to refrain from 
accepting appointment to an institution so long as it remains on the censure 
list. Since circumstances differ widely from case to case, the Association 
does not assert that such an unqualified obligation exists for its members; 
it does urge that, before accepting appointments, they seek information on 
present conditions of academic freedom and tenure from the Association’s 
Washington office and prospective departmental colleagues. The Association 
leaves it to the discretion of the individual, possessed of the facts, to 
make the proper decision. 

The censured administrations, with dates of censuring, are listed below. 
Reports were published as indicated by the Bulletin or Academe citations in 
parentheses following each listing. Reference should also be made to “Developments 
Relating to Censure by the Association” and to the “Report of 
Committee A,” each of which appears annually in Academe.

Postdoctoral/MFA Fellowships: Being Humans 
2012–13 
For artists and humanists, these are extraordinary times: our sense of “the 

human” is undergoing remarkable transformations, with implications for 
the future of all life on the planet. But has “humanism” been part of the 
problem all along? How should we think differently–about the species 
and the biosphere–if we are going to avoid realizing our deepest dystopian 
fears? 

Applicants should have received their terminal degrees (PhDs in the humanities, 
MFAs in the fi ne and per form ing arts, Masters or beyond in 
design fields such as architecture) within the past three years. Applications 
should include a cv, two letters of recommendation, a project description 
of 1000 words, and (for applicants in the arts or design) a sample 
of work on a single DVD. Fellowship stipends are $42,000 plus benefits 
and a $2,000 research fund; fellows will be required to teach one course 
each semester in their discipline. Fellows will be given office space at the 
Institute. It is expected that fellows will take part in the intellectual life 
of campus, working with facult y and students, attending symposia and 
events, and contributing to meetings and discussions presented by IAH.

ical theor y, normative economics and rela ted areas to develop a research 
agenda in the ethical dimensions of public policy. 
Candidates selected will undertake a research project exploring a norma


tive problem arising in an area of public policy in which the Woodrow 
Wilson School sponsors research. They will be affiliated with a unit of the 
School that can inform and support their work. They will also be invited 
to participate in programs of the University Center for Human Values. In 
most cases, candidates will be expected to contribute one course each year 
to the School’s undergraduate program on a topic related to ethical issues 
in public policy. 

Applicants must have completed the requirements for the Ph.D. by September 
1, 2012 and must not have held the degree for more than three 
years by that date. They may not be employed by another institution during 
the term of their Princeton appointment. Applicants’ dissertation research 
need not be specifically in values and public policy, but they will be 
expected to demonstrate a commitment to developing a research project 
in this area during their time at Princeton. Projects related to environmental 
policy, population, health and wellbeing, democratic institutions 
and processes, information technology policy and global governance may 
have an advantage, although we will consider proposals related to any area 

in which the School sponsors research. For more information about these 

areas, please consult http://wws.princeton.edu/centers_programs/. 
Applications will be evaluated on the basis of the applicant’s previous accomplishments 
and the promise of the proposed research project in values 
and public policy. The capacity to contribute to the University’s teaching 
program will also be taken into account. The term of appointment is 
one year, normally beginning September 1, 2012, with the expectation of 
renewal for one further year assuming good performance. Applicants are 
expected to be in residence for the duration of the appointment. Princeton 
offers competitive salary and employee benefits. 

Candidates should subm it an on l ine application by December 15, 2011

Disciplines and Technologies Postdoctoral Scholars 16630 

http://franke.uchicago.edu 
The Disciplines & Technologies Project at the Universit y of Chicago 
invites applications for two Mellon Postdoctoral Scholar positions, each 
of which will last for two academ ic years (2012–14). Each Postdoctoral 
Scholar will be expected to propose and pursue an in-depth study of how 
some technolog y has, over more than one generation, interacted with the 
changing disciplinar y str ucture of universities. “Technolog y” is inter


preted broadly, and we anticipate that one project will touch on natural 
science disciplines and the other on humanistic disciplines; the broader the 
range of disciplines and uses of the technology the better. This research 
will be performed in residence at the Franke Institute for the Humanities 
throughout the academic year (late September to mid-June). Our hope is 
for these projects to interact with and contribute to our larger, ongoing 
project to understand the co-evolution of technologies and disciplines. 

Each Mellon Postdoctoral Scholar wil l be paired with a Facult y mentor 
relevant to the project. Investigators from all disciplines are encouraged 
to apply. Applicants must have fi led their PhDs between 7/1/07 and 
7/1/12, and may not hold any other appointment during the period of the 
Postdoctoral Scholar position. A complete application includes cover letter, 
c.v., and 3–5 page project description, and it should be submitted via 
email to mav@uchicago.edu (Ms. Mai Vukcevich). No application materials
