it does urge that, before accepting appointments, they seek information on present conditions of academic freedom  NA it to the discretion  of the individual, possessed of the facts, to make the proper decision. the censured administrations, with dates of censuring, are listed below. reports were published as indicated by the bulletin or  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA phillips county community college (arkansas) (may 1978,  NA NA NA NA 1983 metropolitan community colleges (missouri) (march april 1984,  NA NA NA 1987 NA NA southeastern baptist theological seminary (north carolina)  NA NA 1990 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 1997 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA albertus magnus college (connecticut) NA 63) ................................................................... 2000 NA NA  NA NA NA 2005 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA clark atlanta university (february 2010) ......................................................... 2010 university of texas medical branch at galveston (april 2010) ............... 2010 bethune cookman university ................................................................................. 2010 louisiana state university, baton rouge ........................................................... 2012 northwestern state university of louisiana ................................................... 2012 southeastern louisiana university ...................................................................... 2012  alabama u of alabama english,
