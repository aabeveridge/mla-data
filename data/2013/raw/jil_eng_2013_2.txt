i MLA JOB INFORMATION LIST • ENGLISH EDITION • February 2013

Information for Candidates

The February List contains information on vacancies from departments of English, comparative literature, and linguistics in US and 
Canadian colleges and universities, as well as some number of overseas institutions and nonacademic enterprises. 

Guide for Using the Job Information List

US and Canadian Departments

The main body of the List, arranged in alphabetical order by state, contains information on definite or possible 
vacancies, comments on notices published in past issues (e.g., that a previously announced position has been filled), 
and notices from departments that expect no vacancies but would nevertheless like to keep résumés on file.

Read through this section item by item to see which departments would welcome your letter of application or inquiry 
at this time. Send letters 
only to departments expressing an interest in a person with your qualifications. If a notice states 
that no vacancies are expected but that the department would like to maintain a file of prospective candidates, 
you 
must decide in each case whether it is worthwhile to write.

General Advice for Candidates

Be sure that your dossier (transcript, letters of recommendation, and other material) is ready to be sent out by your 
placement bureau to any department that requests it. Prepare and duplicate a one-page vita sheet to enclose with 
any letters of application or inquiry. In your letter of application, it is probably wise to express a willingness to be 
interviewed at the department’s convenience. Professional meetings provide a convenient opportunity for such 
interviews.

While it is important to begin to search for a position immediately, you should be aware that hiring goes on all year. 
Surveys indicate that only about half of all English and foreign language departments have begun recruiting by the 
end of December and that the majority of departments do not complete the recruiting process until spring, in some 
cases until summer.

Bear in mind that the candidate who has not limited his or her search for a new position to a particular geographical 
area or kind of institution is most likely to find a position. Do not discount the small colleges where one often 
has the opportunity to teach a wide selection of courses to students of varied backgrounds.

Notice on Tenure Policies

The Modern Language Association recommends that department administrators and their representatives inform 
candidates before or during the interview about prospects for tenure in the specific position under consideration 
and about the tenure policies and practices in their departments and institutions. If the information is not offered, 
candidates are urged to inquire about these policies.

Acknowledgment of Applications

Acting on a recommendation from the MLA Delegate Assembly, the MLA Executive Council has adopted a policy 
calling for departments to acknowledge all applications for announced positions.

MLA Policy on the Reimbursement of Job Seekers

The following policies were recommended by the Delegate Assembly in December 1999 and approved by the MLA 
Executive Council in February 2000.

It is MLA policy that

 • departments that require that job applicants send their application materials by express carrier reimburse those 
applicants for the cost of such shipment; and



ii MLA JOB INFORMATION LIST • ENGLISH EDITION • February 2013

 • departments that require multiple copies of writing samples and other application materials from job applicants 
reimburse applicants for the cost of duplicating their writing samples and other materials; and

 • departments that require books will return them to the applicant; and

 • departments that invite job applicants for on-campus interviews reimburse those applicants who accept such 
invitations for the costs of travel and accommodations incurred when visiting the campus for interviews.



List of Administrations Censured

by the American Association of University Professors

Note: The following list and accompanying explanatory note are reprinted from Academe by permission of the American Association 
of University Professors and in accordance with the action of the MLA Delegate Assembly. 

Investigations by the American Association of University Professors of the administrations of the institutions listed 
below show that, as evidenced by a past violation, they are not observing the generally recognized principles of 
academic freedom and tenure endorsed by this Association, the Association of American Colleges and Universities, 
and more than 150 other professional and educational organizations. The 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic 
Freedom and Tenure may be found in the May-June 1990 issue of Academe.

This list is published for the purpose of informing Association members, the profession at large, and the public that 
unsatisfactory conditions of academic freedom and tenure have been found to prevail at these institutions. Names 
are placed on or removed from this censure list by vote of the Association’s Annual Meeting.

Placing the name of an institution on this list does not mean that censure is visited either upon the whole of the 
institution or upon the faculty, but specifically upon its present administration. The term “administration” includes 
the administrative officers and the governing board of the institution. This censure does not affect the eligibility of 
nonmembers for membership in the Association, nor does it affect the individual rights of members at the institution 
in question.

Members of the Association have often considered it to be their duty, in order to indicate their support of the principles 
violated, 
to refrain from accepting appointment to an institution so long as it remains on the censure list. Since 
circumstances differ widely from case to case, the Association does not assert that such an unqualified obligation 
exists for its members; it does urge that, before accepting appointments, they seek information on present conditions 
of academic freedom and tenure from the Association’s Washington office and prospective departmental colleagues. 
The Association leaves it to the discretion 
of the individual, possessed of the facts, to make the proper decision.

The censured administrations, with dates of censuring, are listed below. Reports were published as indicated by the Bulletin 
or Academe citations in parentheses following each listing. Reference should also be made to “Developments Relating 
to Censure by the Association” and to the “Report of Committee A,” each of which appears annually in Academe.

Dean of Humanities (Job #10276)

College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

Arizona State University seeks a Dean of Humanities in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS) located on 
the Tempe campus. CLAS forms the foundational core of Arizona State University and while it continues to fulfill 
the traditional aim of enabling students to acquire breadth and depth of knowledge and develop critical thinking

national and international boundaries.

The Dean of Humanities will report directly to the Vice Provost and Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and 
Sciences. He or she will provide academic and administrative leadership and will represent the Humanities division 
both inside and outside the University. The Dean of Humanities will also participate in the Executive Vice 
President and Provost’s council for deans. Responsibilities include faculty development, promotion of research, and 
planning and implementation of degree programs, budget, development, personnel, and student academic affairs.

A successful candidate must have:

• familiarity with the range of disciplines within the humanities

• experience as a department chair, director of an academic unit (i.e., school or department), associate dean, dean, 
or equivalent experience

• an excellent record of scholarship

• qualifications for appointment as Professor with tenure in an academic unit in the humanities at ASU

• demonstrated commitment to enhancing the diversity of the faculty, students, and staff

The Department of English

of chairperson on a 12 month contract effective July 1st, 2013. Augusta State University is currently undergoing 
consolidation with Georgia Health Sciences University and, in January, will be a new university with expectations 
of a RU/H status (Research University with High Research Activity). Located along the Savannah River

distance from such major metropolitan areas as Atlanta, Charleston, Savannah, and Columbia, as well as being 
close to the Atlantic Coast and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Augusta is best known as the home of the Masters Golf 
Tournament.

Currently the department offers a B.A. in Foreign Languages (Spanish and French) and a B.A. in English 
with 
concentrations in literature, creative writing, rhetoric and composition, and secondary teacher certification. As we 
move from a regional to a comprehensive university, there will be a growing focus on research and program development. 
Therefore, the department seeks a visionary and flexible candidate with demonstrated departmental and 
university leadership as well as strengths in interpersonal communication and organization to foster an atmosphere 
of growth and innovation. In particular, we seek experience in program and curricular development, budget and 
personnel management, student recruitment and retention, grant writing, and various tools of assessment. While 
scholarship will have an increasingly important role in the future growth of the department and new university, 
our department prides itself on excellence in teaching, close interaction with students through advising and small 
classroom sizes and cross-discipline interaction with faculty from other departments.

The candidate should have a doctorate corresponding with the department and be eligible for appointment at the 
associate or full professor position rank. Academic rank and salary are commensurate with scholarly activities, publications 
and experience. Applicants should submit a letter of application, a current CV and three letters of reference

Assistant Professor Health and Humanities 18165

Apply to this position at https://secure.interfolio.com/apply/19153

EMORY UNIVERSITY, ATLANTA, GA. Health and Humanities. Assistant Professor (tenure-track), beginning 
Fall 2013. Four courses per year, beginning undergraduate to graduate level. Usual advising, committee, and other 
non-teaching duties. PhD required. This position is one of several new faculty appointments in the humanities 
made possible by support from the Mellon Foundation. These interdisciplinary appointments seek to bridge humanities-
based inquiry with other disciplines by applying its traditional principles to new fields of study, through 
using new approaches to examine traditional areas of research, and by exporting principles of critical inquiry across 
the humanities and the academy more broadly.

Through this tenure-track position in Health and Humanities, Emory University wishes to add to its strengths in 
interdisciplinary scholarship and teaching. Candidates must have research programs that study health, illness, disability, 
disease, the provision of health care, the health sciences, or medical technology from a humanities-based 
perspective. Broad fields of interest appropriate for this position include but are not limited to: cultural, historical, 
or philosophical studies of medicine, nursing, or public health; studies of race, gender, sexuality, and social justice 
in health care; literary and artistic explorations of health and illness; disability studies; studies of discourse and narrative; 
and the ethics of the health professions.

The successful applicant will have a tenure home in a particular humanities department, but will be expected to 
collaborate with and benefit from different departments, centers, and schools (especially the many health-related 
schools) within the University. This position is open to scholars across the humanities, including African American 
studies, area studies, art history, film and media studies, history, all literature and language departments, religion, 
philosophy, science and technology studies, and women’s, gender and sexuality studies. Review of applications 
begins December 1, 2012, and applications received before December 15, 2012, will be given full consideration; fi



nalists will be invited for campus visits beginning in February 2013. Applications should include a cover letter that 
addresses the position description and describes research plans, c.v., writing sample, teaching portfolio, and three 
confidential letters of reference. Referees should send their letters by email attachment, and should write the name 
of the applicant in the subject line of the email. Nominations are invited. Applications, letters of reference, and 
nominations should be emailed to Dr. Mark Risjord, Search Committee Chair at mellon3@ emory .edu.

EMORY UNIVERSITY, ATLANTA, GA. Law, Ethics and Society. Assistant Professor (tenure-track), beginning 
Fall 2013. Four courses per year, beginning undergraduate to graduate level. Usual advising, committee, and other 
non-teaching duties. PhD required.

This position is one of several new faculty appointments in the humanities made possible by support from the Andrew 
W. Mellon Foundation. These interdisciplinary appointments seek to bridge humanistic inquiry with other 
disciplines by applying its traditional principles to new fields of study; by examining traditional areas of research 
and teaching by means of new approaches; and by exporting principles of humanistic inquiry across not only the 
humanities but the academy much more broadly.

We seek scholars whose work reflects on the origins, institutional frameworks, and philosophical foundations of 
the relations among law, ethics, and society: what the law is, how it has come to be, and what it ought to be in the 
wider context of society. Within this broad area, we are especially interested in receiving applications from individuals 
who focus on legal narratives and law as literature; citizenship, nationality, and/or non-citizenship within the 
United States or within a transnational or comparative perspective; or gender, sexuality, race, social class, disability, 
and/or other identities within the United States or from a transnational perspective.

It is expected that successful applicants will have a tenure home in a humanities department, but the successful 
applicant will have research and teaching interests that are broadly interdisciplinary (perhaps bridging different 
colleges within the University). This position is open to scholars across the humanities and arts, including all literatures 
and language departments, history and all area studies, philosophy, religion, women's, gender, and sexuality 
studies, African American Studies, film and media studies, and legal studies.

Review of applications begins December 1, 2012; applications received before December 15, 2012 will be given 
full consideration. Applications must include a cover letter and a current CV. Send applications electronically to

Director and Librarian John Carter Brown Library 18451

Apply to this position at https://secure.interfolio.com/apply/20810

Brown University and the Board of Governors of the John Carter Brown Library seek a Director and Librarian. 
The John Carter Brown Library is an independently administered library and research center, founded in 1846 and 
located at Brown University since 1901. Throughout its history, the Library has served scholars from the United 
States and abroad. The Library offers fellowships, sponsors lectures and conferences, regularly mounts exhibitions 
for the public, and publishes catalogues, bibliographies, and other works that interpret its holdings.

The Director will oversee and build upon its world-renowned collection of primary sources for the study of North 
and South America during the colonial period (ca. 1492 to ca. 1825).

The Director will lead and supervise all aspects of the Library’s operations and programs, and will be responsible 
for the enhancement and growth of the Library’s renowned collection and reputation as a leading international 
center for advanced research in history and the humanities, as well as administer the cultivation and procurement of 
requisite resources, including grant proposals.

The successful candidate should have an earned doctorate in a field directly related to the scope of the collection 
and interests of the Library, and will ideally have had proven administrative supervisory experience in a scholarly 
setting. Extraordinary candidates without an earned doctorate or comparable administrative experience will be 
considered. The Director oversees all operational, programmatic, and management activities of the Library, has 



ultimate supervisory authority over all staff, and is responsible for the budget. The Director is also responsible for 
managing the Library's community of long-and short-term fellows.

The Director will report to the Provost of Brown University with respect to university administrative matters. 
With regard to the goals and directions of the Library, the Director will report to the Library’s Board of Governors.

The Library’s collection of 50,000 rare books (printed before ca. 1825) and 16,000 reference books and secondary 
sources (printed after ca. 1825) is distinguished in numerous subject areas. The Library’s extensive holdings in the 
literature of European exploration and travel in the Western Hemisphere, from the first Latin editions of the Columbus 
letter of 1493, through nearly all of the contemporary narratives of Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, 
Dutch, and English 
discovery, exploration, and settlement are well known. The geography and anthropology of the 
Americas, the economic incentives for colonization, the social and political character of New World settlements, 
and the response of indigenous peoples to the European incursion are all also well covered in the collection. The 
Library’s interest in procuring printed and manuscript sources, specifically illustrative of the impact of America on 
Europe, has continuously enriched the collection. At least 20 percent of the collection consists of books printed 
before 1700. The Library’s collection of early maps relating to the Western Hemisphere is among the finest in the 
world.

The Library’s close association with Brown University and its faculty, as well as its links to scholars and institutions 
in the United States and abroad, offers a network of resources invaluable for fellows and researchers of its collections. 
The Library also provides for and fosters educational and research opportunities for the graduate and undergraduate 
educational community through the engagement of the Brown faculty.

In recent years the Library has taken a leadership role to digitize its collections and in making its holdings broadly 
available. It is expected that a successful candidate will bring a strong creative vision for its continued successful 
work going forward.

Review of candidates will begin on December 15, 2012 and will continue until the Director is named. Inquiries 
can be addressed to Kimberly Roskiewicz, Assistant to the President, Brown University at Kimberly_ Roskiewicz@ Brown .edu. Applications should include a letter of intent, a curriculum vita and names of three references.

For artists and humanists, these are extraordinary times: our sense of “the human” is undergoing remarkable transformations, 
with implications for the future of all life on the planet. But has “humanism” been part of the problem 
all along? How should we think differently–about the biosphere and the social world–if we are going to avoid realizing 
our deepest dystopian fears?

The Penn State IAH welcomes applications for a one-year fellowship commencing July 1, 2013, from scholars and 
artists who have received their terminal degrees (PhDs in the humanities, MFAs in the fine and performing arts, 
Masters or beyond in design fields such as architecture) within the past three years. Applications should include a 
CV, contact information for two references, a project description of 1000 words, and (for applicants in the arts or 
design) a hyperlink or other access to a digital portfolio. Fellowship stipends are $42,000 plus benefits and a $2,000 
research fund; fellows will be asked to teach one class and lead a faculty/graduate student research group and/or 
organize a symposium. Fellows will be given office space at the Institute. It is expected that fellows will take part in 
the intellectual life of campus by working with faculty and students, attending symposia and events, and contributing 
to meetings and discussions presented by IAH.

The University Center for Human Values and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs invite 
applications for postdoctoral positions in Values and Public Policy. We aim to support highly promising scholars 
trained in moral and political philosophy, political theory, normative economics and related areas to develop a 
research agenda in the ethical dimensions of public policy.

Candidates selected will undertake a research project exploring a normative problem arising in an area of public 
policy in which the Woodrow Wilson School sponsors research. Candidates will be expected to contribute one 
course each year to the School’s undergraduate program on a topic related to ethical issues in public policy.

Applicants must have completed the requirements for the Ph.D. by September 1, 2013 and must not have held the 
degree for more than three years by that date. They may not be employed by another institution during the term of 
their Princeton appointment.

Applicants’ dissertation research need not be specifically in values and public policy, but they will be expected to 
demonstrate a commitment to developing a research project in this area during their time at Princeton. Projects 
related to environmental policy, population and health, democratic institutions and processes, information technology 
policy and global governance may have an advantage, although we will consider proposals related to any 
area in which the School sponsors research. For more information about these areas, please consult http:// wws 
.princeton .edu/ centers_ programs/.

The term of appointment is one year, normally beginning September 1, 2013, with the expectation of renewal for 
one further year assuming good performance. Applicants are expected to be in residence for the duration of the 
appointment.

Candidates should submit an online application at http:// jobs .princeton .edu. Search for requisition number 
#1200508. The online system includes instructions on how to apply.

Materials should be submitted online by Monday, December 3, 2012. We cannot accept application materials by 
any other method. Decisions will be announced by Thursday, March 28, 2013.
