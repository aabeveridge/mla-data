i MLA JOB INFORMATION LIST • ENGLISH EDITION • APRIL 2013

Information for Candidates

The April List contains information on vacancies from departments of English, comparative literature, and linguistics in US and 
Canadian colleges and universities, as well as some number of overseas institutions and nonacademic enterprises. 

Guide for Using the Job Information List

US and Canadian Departments

The main body of the List, arranged in alphabetical order by state, contains information on definite or possible vacancies, 
comments on notices published in past issues (e.g., that a previously announced position has been filled), and notices from 
departments that expect no vacancies but would nevertheless like to keep résumés on file.

Read through this section item by item to see which departments would welcome your letter of application or inquiry at this 
time. Send letters 
only to departments expressing an interest in a person with your qualifications. If a notice states that no vacancies 
are expected but that the department would like to maintain a file of prospective candidates, 
you must decide in each 
case whether it is worthwhile to write.

General Advice for Candidates

Be sure that your dossier (transcript, letters of recommendation, and other material) is ready to be sent out by your placement 
bureau to any department that requests it. Prepare and duplicate a one-page vita sheet to enclose with any letters of 
application or inquiry. In your letter of application, it is probably wise to express a willingness to be interviewed at the department’s 
convenience. Professional meetings provide a convenient opportunity for such interviews.

While it is important to begin to search for a position immediately, you should be aware that hiring goes on all year. Surveys 
indicate that only about half of all English and foreign language departments have begun recruiting by the end of December 
and that the majority of departments do not complete the recruiting process until spring, in some cases until summer.

Bear in mind that the candidate who has not limited his or her search for a new position to a particular geographical area or 
kind of institution is most likely to find a position. Do not discount the small colleges where one often has the opportunity 
to teach a wide selection of courses to students of varied backgrounds.

Notice on Tenure Policies

The Modern Language Association recommends that department administrators and their representatives inform candidates 
before or during the interview about prospects for tenure in the specific position under consideration and about the 
tenure policies and practices in their departments and institutions. If the information is not offered, candidates are urged 
to inquire about these policies.

Acknowledgment of Applications

Acting on a recommendation from the MLA Delegate Assembly, the MLA Executive Council has adopted a policy calling 
for departments to acknowledge all applications for announced positions.

MLA Policy on the Reimbursement of Job Seekers

The following policies were recommended by the Delegate Assembly in December 1999 and approved by the MLA Executive 
Council in February 2000.

It is MLA policy that

 • departments that require that job applicants send their application materials by express carrier reimburse those applicants 
for the cost of such shipment; and

 • departments that require multiple copies of writing samples and other application materials from job applicants reimburse 
applicants for the cost of duplicating their writing samples and other materials; and

 • departments that require books will return them to the applicant; and



ii MLA JOB INFORMATION LIST • ENGLISH EDITION • APRIL 2013

 • departments that invite job applicants for on-campus interviews reimburse those applicants who accept such invitations 
for the costs of travel and accommodations incurred when visiting the campus for interviews.



List of Administrations Censured

by the American Association of University Professors

Note: The following list and accompanying explanatory note are reprinted from Academe by permission of the American Association 
of University Professors and in accordance with the action of the MLA Delegate Assembly. 

Investigations by the American Association of University Professors of the administrations of the institutions listed below 
show that, as evidenced by a past violation, they are not observing the generally recognized principles of academic freedom 
and tenure endorsed by this Association, the Association of American Colleges and Universities, and more than 150 
other professional and educational organizations. The 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure may be 
found in the May-June 1990 issue of Academe.

This list is published for the purpose of informing Association members, the profession at large, and the public that unsatisfactory 
conditions of academic freedom and tenure have been found to prevail at these institutions. Names are placed on or 
removed from this censure list by vote of the Association’s Annual Meeting.

Placing the name of an institution on this list does not mean that censure is visited either upon the whole of the institution 
or upon the faculty, but specifically upon its present administration. The term “administration” includes the administrative 
officers and the governing board of the institution. This censure does not affect the eligibility of nonmembers for membership 
in the Association, nor does it affect the individual rights of members at the institution in question.

Members of the Association have often considered it to be their duty, in order to indicate their support of the principles 
violated, 
to refrain from accepting appointment to an institution so long as it remains on the censure list. Since circumstances 
differ widely from case to case, the Association does not assert that such an unqualified obligation exists for its 
members; it does urge that, before accepting appointments, they seek information on present conditions of academic freedom 
and tenure from the Association’s Washington office and prospective departmental colleagues. The Association leaves 
it to the discretion 
of the individual, possessed of the facts, to make the proper decision.

The censured administrations, with dates of censuring, are listed below. Reports were published as indicated by the Bulletin or 
Academe citations in parentheses following each listing. Reference should also be made to “Developments Relating to Censure by 
the Association” and to the “Report of Committee A,” each of which appears annually in Academe.

excellence has been a hallmark of the University.
