Accessing the Electronic JIL

All access to search the online version of the Job Information List is now through membership in 
either the Association of Departments of English (ADE) or the Association of Departments of Foreign 
Languages (ADFL). 

Access to search the JIL is free to graduate students and faculty members in departments that 
are members of the ADE or the ADFL. If your department is a member, it can provide you with 
the department ID and password to log in at the ADE or ADFL Web site. When you log in, you 
will be asked to create your own personal login information for searching the JIL at that site. 

MLA members in ADE- and ADFL-member departments can also log in to search the JIL at 
the MLA Web site with their MLA-member user name and password. No additional user name or 
password is required. 

Individuals without an academic affiliation or whose departments are not currently members of 
the ADE or the ADFL can access the JIL by becoming affiliate members of the ADE or the ADFL. 
Like students and faculty members in ADE- and ADFL-member departments, ADE and ADFL affiliate 
members receive access to the online archive of the ADE or the ADFL Bulletins as well as 
rights to search the JIL database over the Internet. (Print versions of the JIL are no longer available 
to individuals.) Dues for affiliate memberships are $40 for MLA members and $65 for nonmembers 
and are refundable on request to those whose departments become members of the ADE or the 
ADFL within the membership period, which runs from September to August. Affiliate memberships 
must be purchased online with a credit card and are for the use of a single individual only.

MLA JOB INFORMATION LIST i

Information for Candidates

In This Issue

The February issue contains notices describing approximately 340 definite and possible positions.

Guide for Using the Job Information List

US and Canadian Departments

The main body of the List, arranged in alphabetical order by 
state, contains information on definite or possible vacancies and 
notices from departments that expect no vacancies but would 
nevertheless like to keep résumés on file.

Read through this section item by item to see which departments 
would welcome your letter of application or inquiry at this 
time. Send letters only to departments expressing an interest in a 
person with your qualifications. If a notice states that no vacancies 
are expected but that the department would like to maintain a file 
of prospective candidates, you must decide in each case whether it 
is worthwhile to write.

Comparative Literature and Linguistics and ESL Sections

Notices in these fields have been separated out from the main 
body of the issue and placed under the appropriate heading.

General Advice for Candidates

Be sure that your dossier (transcript, letters of recommendation, 
and other material) is ready to be sent out by your placement 
bureau to any department that requests it. Prepare and duplicate 
a one-page vita sheet to enclose with any letters of application or 
inquiry. In your letter of application, it is probably wise to express 
a willingness to be interviewed at the department’s convenience. 
Professional meetings provide a convenient opportunity for such 
interviews.

While it is important to begin to search for a position immediately, 
you should be aware that hiring goes on all year. Surveys 
indicate that only about half of all English and foreign language 
departments have begun recruiting by the end of December and 
that the majority of departments do not complete the recruiting 
process until spring, in some cases until summer.

Bear in mind that the candidate who has not limited his or her 
search for a new position to a particular geographical area or kind 
of institution is most likely to find a position. Do not discount 
the small colleges where one often has the opportunity to teach a 
wide selection of courses to students of varied backgrounds.

Notice on Tenure Policies

The Modern Language Association recommends that department 
administrators and their representatives inform candidates 
before or during the interview about prospects for tenure in the 
specific position under consideration and about the tenure policies 
and practices in their departments and institutions. If the information 
is not offered, candidates are urged to inquire about 
these policies.

Acknowledgment of Applications

Acting on a recommendation from the MLA Delegate Assembly, 
the MLA Executive Council has adopted a policy calling for 
departments to acknowledge all applications for announced positions 
either by letter or by self-addressed postcards provided by 
applicants.

MLA Policy on the Reimbursement of Job Seekers

The following policies were recommended by the Delegate 
Assembly in December 1999 and approved by the MLA Executive 
Council in February 2000.

It is MLA policy that:

 • Departments that require that job applicants send their application 
materials by express carrier reimburse those applicants 
for the cost of such shipment; and

 • Departments that require multiple copies of writing samples 
and other application materials from job applicants reimburse 
applicants for the cost of duplicating their writing samples 
and other materials; and

 • Departments that require books will return them to the applicant; 
and

 • Departments that invite job applicants for on-campus interviews 
reimburse those applicants who accept such invitations 
for the costs of travel and accommodations incurred when 
visiting the campus for interviews.



ii ENGLISH EDITION • FEBRUARY 2009

List of Administrations Censured

by the American Association of University Professors

Note: The following list and accompanying explanatory note are reprinted from Academe by permission of the American 
Association of University Professors and in accordance with the action of the MLA Delegate Assembly.

Investigations by the American Association of University Professors 
of the administrations of the institutions listed below show that, as 
evidenced by a past violation, they are not observing the generally recognized 
principles of academic freedom and tenure endorsed by this Association, 
the Association of American Colleges and Universities, and 
more than 150 other professional and educational organizations. The 
1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure may be found 
in the May-June 1990 issue of Academe.

This list is published for the purpose of informing Association members, 
the profession at large, and the public that unsatisfactory conditions 
of academic freedom and tenure have been found to prevail at these institutions. 
Names are placed on or removed from this censure list by vote 
of the Association’s Annual Meeting.

Placing the name of an institution on this list does not mean that censure 
is visited either upon the whole of the institution or upon the faculty, but 
specifically upon its present administration. The term “administration” includes 
the administrative officers and the governing board of the institution. 
This censure does not affect the eligibility of nonmembers for membership 
in the Association, nor does it affect the individual rights of members at the 
institution in question.

Members of the Association have often considered it to be their duty, 
in order to indicate their support of the principles violated, 
to refrain 
from accepting appointment to an institution so long as it remains on 
the censure list. Since circumstances differ widely from case to case, the 
Association does not assert that such an unqualified obligation exists 
for its members; it does urge that, before accepting appointments, they 
seek information on present conditions of academic freedom and tenure 
from the Association’s Washington office and prospective departmental 
colleagues. The Association leaves it to the discretion 
of the individual, 
possessed of the facts, to make the proper decision.

The censured administrations, with dates of censuring, are listed 
below. Reports were published as indicated by the Bulletin or Academe 
citations in parentheses following each listing. Reference should also be 
made to “Developments Relating to Censure by the Association” and 
to the “Report of Committee A,” each of which appears annually in 
Academe.

Fraser University as a Canadian and global university.

The diversity of the student body at the University’s three closely connected 
urban campuses—at Surrey, Burnaby, and Vancouver—reflects the

at SFU Surrey in the future.

The appointment will be at the rank of Associate or Full Professor. While

in two linguistic, literary, and cultural traditions. Applications are encouraged 
from scholars with credentials in comparative literature, with expertise 
in literatures other than English,

interests. Appointments will be made commensurate with experience in 
research, teaching, and administration.

current and future interests in research and teaching as well as administrative 
philosophy and experience. The letter must be accompanied by a curriculum 
vitae and two examples of peer-reviewed publications. Please also 
include a teaching dossier with a short statement of teaching philosophy, 
three sample syllabi, and evidence of excellence in teaching. If applicable, 
include a summary of your experience in curricular development, in departmental 
or university governance, and in mentoring new scholars.

Applicants must also arrange for three letters of reference to be sent directly 
to Dr. Heather Dawkins at the address below. The deadline for applications 
is February 15, 2009 or until the position is filled.

All materials should be sent to: Dr. Heather Dawkins, Associate Dean,
