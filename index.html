<h1 id="mla-jil-text-data">MLA JIL Text Data</h1>
<p>This repository is a curated collection of job descriptions mined from the MLA Jobs Information Lists. This is an on-going project meant to eventually enable the text mining of job description data from the JIL and other sources.</p>
<p>The raw text data for this project was extracted from PDFs downloaded at: http://rhetmap.org and https://www.mla.org/jil_issues</p>
<h1 id="writing-and-rhetoric-jobs-analysis">Writing and Rhetoric Jobs Analysis</h1>
<p>The &quot;Reports&quot; folder in this repository will eventually have data visualizations and analyses specific to writing studies and rhetoric. This includes word frequency data, word correlation data, and year-to-year comparisons across all job description data.</p>
